# Thesis Skeleton: AI-Powered Multi-Agent System for Meeting Transcript Processing

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background on Artificial Intelligence
- Brief history of AI development:
- Distinction between traditional ML/AI and generative AI
- Recent advancements and the "AI boom"

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as one of the most transformative technologies of the 21st century, reshaping industries, augmenting human capabilities, and redefining the boundaries of what machines can achieve. For decades, traditional AI approaches have been solving complex problems: from IBM's Deep Blue defeating world chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, to the development of sophisticated fraud detection systems in finance, and the implementation of AI-driven recommendation engines that personalize our digital experiences. However, the AI landscape has undergone a dramatic shift in recent years, marked by a distinct separation between these established machine learning approaches and a new wave of generative AI technologies. This "AI boom" has catapulted the field into the spotlight, capturing public imagination and prompting both excitement and trepidation about the future of human-machine interaction.

### 1.2 The Rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Introduction to LLMs and their capabilities
- Impact of LLMs on natural language processing
- Spotlight on influential models (e.g., GPT series, BERT)

The recent surge in AI capabilities has been driven by a convergence of key technological advancements. Unprecedented access to vast amounts of data, coupled with exponential growth in computing power, has enabled the training of increasingly sophisticated models [REF1]. Breakthroughs in neural network architectures, particularly the development of transformer models [REF2], have dramatically improved AI's ability to process and generate human-like text, images, and even code. This technological leap has given rise to Large Language Models (LLMs) such as the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series [REF3], which have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human language. These models can engage in open-ended conversations, answer questions, and perform complex reasoning tasks with a level of fluency and coherence that significantly surpasses previous AI systems [REF4].
