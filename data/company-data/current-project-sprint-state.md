### Sprint Burndown
[To be updated as the sprint progresses]

### Impediments
| Impediment | Impact | Mitigation Plan | Status |
|------------|--------|-----------------|--------|
| CI/CD pipeline issues | Delays in automated testing and deployment | Olivia to resolve intermittent failures in end-to-end tests, address Docker containerization issues, resolve compatibility issues with security scanning tools | Open |
| Data model scalability concerns | Potential performance issues with large datasets | Michael and Alex to prototype scalability solutions, consider data archiving strategy | Open |
| Delay in third-party API documentation | May slow down integration process | Alex to follow up on updated documentation from API provider | Open |

### Key Decisions
- Implement protected routes for authenticated users
- Use JWT for session management
- Integrate Chart.js for data visualization in the health dashboard
- Implement responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Set up daily stand-ups at 9:30 AM for alignment and blocker resolution
- Allocate more time for knowledge sharing among team members

### Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Plan |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| Overcommitment of story points | High | High | More conservative estimations for complex features or new technologies, enhanced sprint planning process with thorough task breakdown |
| Integration challenges with third-party APIs | Medium | Medium | Alex to follow up on third-party API documentation |
| Performance issues with current database schema | Medium | High | Michael and Alex to collaborate on database optimization strategies |

### Sprint Ceremonies
- Daily Scrum: 9:30 AM, Virtual meeting room
- Sprint Review: July 3, 2023, 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM
- Sprint Retrospective: July 3, 2023 (following Sprint Review)
