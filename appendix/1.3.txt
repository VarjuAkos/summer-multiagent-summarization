• Pay attention to team dynamics and note any areas of consensus or disagreement
• Be mindful of technical jargon and ensure accurate capture of technical discussions
• Look for patterns or recurring themes that might indicate project priorities or concerns
• Consider the broader context of the project when analyzing discussions and decisions
• Be thorough in capturing details, as seemingly minor points may become important later
