Date: 2024-06-10
Duration: 2 hours
Attendees: Sarah Chen (Scrum Master), Alex Rodriguez (Senior Full-Stack Developer), Emily Watson (Frontend Developer), Michael Kim (Backend Developer), Olivia Martinez (QA Engineer/DevOps Specialist), Liam Foster (UI/UX Designer)

## Project Context
HealthTrack Pro is a comprehensive web application for personal health management, allowing users to track activities, nutrition, and health metrics. The project started on June 10, 2024, with an estimated timeline of 6 months for the MVP release. Key MVP goals include user authentication, activity tracking, nutrition logging, and a basic health metrics dashboard.

## I. Introduction and Roll Call

Sarah Chen opened the meeting, welcoming the team to the official start of the HealthTrack Pro project. All team members confirmed their attendance.

## II. Project Kickoff Overview

Sarah emphasized the focus on establishing the first sprint backlog and aligning on MVP phase requirements for HealthTrack Pro.

## III. Sprint Duration Discussion

- Proposal: Two-week sprints
- Decision: Unanimously agreed upon two-week sprints
  - Rationale: 
    - Alex Rodriguez: Need time for development environment setup and workflow establishment
    - Olivia Martinez: Allows proper setup of CI/CD pipeline and testing frameworks
  - Alignment with project requirements: Supports the need for a robust foundation and allows for iterative development of core features

## IV. Team Capacity Planning

- Discussion on story point commitment for the first sprint
- Decision: Reduce normal capacity by 20-25% for initial setup time
  - Michael Kim suggested this reduction to account for environment setup and architecture decisions
  - Emily Watson agreed, noting the need for team adjustment period
- Risk factor: Potential delay in feature delivery due to reduced capacity, mitigated by focusing on foundational elements

## V. MVP Requirements Review

### D. Nutrition Logging Feature

1. Food Database Approach
   - Decision: Start with a basic database of common foods (suggested by Alex Rodriguez)
     - Create a JSON file with 1000 most common food items
     - Include manual entry option for custom foods
   - Alignment with requirements: Supports core feature of nutrition logging (Requirement 3.4)

   - Quick search with auto-complete suggestions
   - Manual entry option
   - Save frequently used items feature
   - Alignment with requirements: Supports food and meal logging with nutritional information (Requirement 3.4.1)

3. Calorie and Nutrient Calculations
   - Michael Kim to write a service for basic calculations (calories, protein, carbs, fats)
   - Plan to add more complex nutrient tracking in future sprints
   - Alignment with requirements: Meets basic nutritional goal setting and tracking (Requirement 3.4.6)

4. Data Visualization
   - Emily Watson: Dashboard to include charts for macro breakdowns and daily intake trends
   - Alex Rodriguez suggested using a lightweight charting library (Chart.js or Recharts)
   - Alignment with requirements: Supports macronutrient analysis (Requirement 3.4.7)
