# HealthTrack Pro: Initial Sprint Planning Meeting

Date: 2024-06-10
Duration: 2 hours
Attendees: Sarah Chen (Scrum Master), Alex Rodriguez, Emily Watson, Michael Kim, Olivia Martinez, Liam Foster

## I. Introduction and Roll Call

Sarah Chen opened the meeting, welcoming the team to the official start of the HealthTrack Pro project. All team members confirmed their attendance.

## II. Project Kickoff Overview

Sarah emphasized the focus on establishing the first sprint backlog and aligning on MVP phase requirements for HealthTrack Pro, a comprehensive web application for personal health management.

## III. Sprint Duration Discussion

- Proposal: Two-week sprints
- Decision: Unanimously agreed upon two-week sprints
  - Rationale: 
    - Alex Rodriguez: Need time for development environment setup and workflow establishment
    - Olivia Martinez: Allows proper setup of CI/CD pipeline and testing frameworks

## IV. Team Capacity Planning

- Discussion on story point commitment for the first sprint
- Decision: Reduce normal capacity by 20-25% for initial setup time
  - Michael Kim suggested this reduction to account for environment setup and architecture decisions
  - Emily Watson agreed, noting the need for team adjustment period

## V. MVP Requirements Review

### A. User Authentication

1. Technical Requirements (led by Alex Rodriguez)
   - Proposal: Custom JWT implementation for MVP, designed for future OAuth integration
   - Backend: Use Passport.js with Node.js server (suggested by Michael Kim)
   - Frontend: Emily Watson to create login/registration forms, password reset, and token management
   - Security: Olivia Martinez to set up automated security scans and penetration testing in CI/CD pipeline

2. UI/UX (presented by Liam Foster)
   - Login page design reviewed
   - Accessibility considerations confirmed:
     - Proper labeling and ARIA attributes
     - Keyboard navigation support
     - Clear focus states

### B. Definition of Done Criteria

Established criteria:
1. Code review completed
2. Unit tests written and passing
3. Integration tests passed
4. Security scan passed
5. Documentation updated
6. Responsive design implemented
7. Cross-browser testing done
8. Accessibility requirements met
9. API documentation updated
10. Database migrations tested
11. Performance benchmarks met
12. Successfully deployed to staging environment (added by Olivia Martinez)

### C. Activity Tracking Feature

1. Data Model Discussion
   - Alex Rodriguez: Need flexible data model for different activity types
   - Real-time updates discussion postponed for future sprints
     - Initial approach: Regular REST endpoints
     - Emily Watson: Implement optimistic updates on frontend for responsiveness

2. UI/UX (presented by Liam Foster)
   - Dashboard view with cards for different activity types
   - Floating action button for quick activity addition
   - Summary view at the top
   - Emily Watson raised concern about animation performance; agreed to simplify transitions for initial release

### D. Nutrition Logging Feature

1. Food Database Approach
   - Decision: Start with a basic database of common foods (suggested by Alex Rodriguez)
     - Create a JSON file with 1000 most common food items
     - Include manual entry option for custom foods

2. User Interface Design (presented by Liam Foster)
   - Quick search with auto-complete suggestions
   - Manual entry option
   - Save frequently used items feature

3. Calorie and Nutrient Calculations
   - Michael Kim to write a service for basic calculations (calories, protein, carbs, fats)
   - Plan to add more complex nutrient tracking in future sprints

4. Data Visualization
   - Emily Watson: Dashboard to include charts for macro breakdowns and daily intake trends
   - Alex Rodriguez suggested using a lightweight charting library (Chart.js or Recharts)

## VI. Task Breakdown and Estimation

### A. Authentication System
1. Backend auth system (JWT implementation, password hashing, basic security): 5 story points (Alex)
2. Frontend auth components (forms, validation, token management): 5 story points (Emily)
3. Database schema design and implementation for user profiles: 3 story points (Michael)

### B. Activity Tracking
1. Backend API endpoints and data validation: 8 story points (Alex)
2. Security measures (data validation middleware, rate limiting): 2 story points (Michael)
3. Frontend components (activity input forms, list views, basic filtering): 8 story points (Emily)
4. Dashboard widgets: 5 story points (Emily)
5. Testing setup and core test cases: 4 story points (Olivia)
6. End-to-end testing with Cypress: 3 story points (Olivia)

### C. Nutrition Tracking
1. Backend API and basic food database setup: 6 story points (Alex)
2. Nutrient calculation service: 4 story points (Michael)
3. Frontend components for food logging: 6 story points (Emily)
4. Visualization components: 5 story points (Emily)
5. Testing for nutrition tracking features: 3 story points (Olivia)

## VII. Development Environment Setup

1. CI/CD Pipeline (Olivia)
   - Jenkins pipeline configuration
   - Automated builds, test runs, and deployments to staging environment
   - Docker containers for consistency across environments
     - Separate containers for frontend, backend, and database
     - Docker Compose for local development

2. Git Workflow
   - Feature branches with pull requests for review
   - Main branch always deployable
   - Develop branch for integration
   - Automatic deploy previews for frontend changes

3. Database Migrations
   - Michael to help set up from the start

## VIII. Sprint Backlog Finalization

Focus areas for the first sprint:
1. Development environment setup
2. Basic authentication system
3. Initial user profile features
4. Start on activity tracking components

## IX. Closing Items

1. Wireframe finalization: Liam to polish and share in Figma by tomorrow, including basic component library documentation
2. Daily standup time: Set for 10 AM
3. Additional technical session: Scheduled for after tomorrow's standup to discuss database schema in detail (30 minutes)
