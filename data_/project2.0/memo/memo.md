4. State Management: Redux (confirmed after discussion)

### B. Testing Frameworks
1. Frontend: Jest and React Testing Library
2. Backend: Mocha and Chai

### C. CI/CD Pipeline
Olivia will set up the CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins.

### D. Design System
Liam will set up the initial design system in Figma, focusing on components needed for authentication and profile management.

### E. Database Schema
Michael will design the initial database schema for user information, considering future scalability for health data storage.

## VIII. Risk Identification and Mitigation

The team identified the following risks and mitigation strategies:

1. Data security and GDPR compliance
   - Mitigation: Schedule a session on data security and GDPR compliance (led by Alex)

2. Cross-browser compatibility
   - Mitigation: Set up early browser testing

3. Design-development alignment
   - Mitigation: Implement daily check-ins between design and development teams

4. Integration challenges
   - Mitigation: Allocate 3 story points as a buffer for troubleshooting

5. Scope creep
   - Mitigation: Strictly adhere to the sprint backlog. Any new requirements or changes will be added to the product backlog for future sprints.

## IX. Sprint Backlog Creation

The team spent 30 minutes selecting items for the sprint backlog, ensuring alignment with the sprint goal and balancing workload across team members.

## X. Project Management Tool Selection

The team unanimously chose Jira as the project management tool over Trello due to its comprehensive tracking and reporting features, and good integration with testing and CI/CD tools.

## XI. Meeting Wrap-up

Sarah recapped the key decisions and next steps:

1. Two-week sprint (June 24 - July 7, 2024) focused on user authentication and basic profile management
2. Sprint backlog set up with 32 story points (including buffer)
3. Alex to lead a session on data security and GDPR compliance (scheduled for June 25, 2024)
4. Olivia to set up testing environments and start on the CI/CD pipeline
