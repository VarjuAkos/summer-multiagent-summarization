# Sprint 2 Planning Meeting - HealthTrack Pro Project

Date: 2024-07-04
Time: 10:00 AM - 12:45 PM
Attendees: Sarah Chen (Scrum Master), Alex Rodriguez, Emily Watson, Michael Kim, Olivia Martinez, Liam Foster

## I. Meeting Opening and Sprint 1 Recap

Sarah Chen opened the meeting at 10 AM, acknowledging the team's achievements in Sprint 1:
- Successful implementation of the authentication system
- Significant progress on database structure development
- Achieved 87% WCAG compliance, surpassing the initial target

Alex Rodriguez highlighted the WCAG compliance achievement, while Emily Watson noted the smooth functioning of the authentication system across most browsers, with some Safari-specific issues still to be addressed.

## II. Team Capacity and Schedule Constraints

The team discussed upcoming schedule constraints:
- Michael Kim will be attending a database conference next Thursday but will be available remotely for critical discussions.
- Emily Watson has a dental appointment on Tuesday afternoon.
- Liam Foster has user research sessions scheduled for Wednesday morning but will be available for the rest of the day.

Based on these constraints, the team agreed to slightly adjust the story point commitment for Sprint 2.

## III. Sprint 2 Focus: Health Metrics Dashboard Implementation

### A. Technical Architecture Discussion

Michael Kim proposed changes to the data partitioning strategy based on his recent analysis. He suggested a hybrid approach:
- Time-based partitioning for time-series data like daily health metrics
- Hash partitioning for reference data and user profiles

Alex Rodriguez initially suggested a simpler approach but agreed with Michael's proposal after further discussion. The team agreed that this strategy would provide better query performance across different access patterns.

Michael assured that the new partitioning strategy would maintain field-level encryption for sensitive health data.

### B. Frontend Considerations

Emily Watson and Liam Foster reported progress on component library updates to handle real-time updates efficiently. Liam offered to share screen to show new widget prototypes designed for both performance and accessibility.

## IV. Nutrition Logging Feature Completion

Alex Rodriguez highlighted challenges with the NutriAPI Pro integration, particularly in error handling and offline support.

Emily Watson proposed a two-tier caching strategy for offline functionality, but Michael Kim expressed concerns about memory implications.

Key points to address:
1. Offline support
2. Data synchronization
3. Smooth user experience during poor connectivity
4. Clear indicators for data freshness in the UI

The team agreed to schedule a separate technical sync to discuss these issues in detail.

## V. Accessibility Improvements

Current status: 87% WCAG compliance
Target: 95% WCAG compliance

Liam Foster led the discussion on main issues:
1. Color contrast problems in macro-nutrient charts
2. Keyboard navigation improvements needed

Emily Watson mentioned adapting the focus trap manager from the authentication flow for the nutrition interface.

Liam presented alternative designs meeting WCAG AA requirements while maintaining visual appeal.

Estimated timeline:
- 2 days for color updates
- 2 days for keyboard navigation improvements
- Additional time for thorough testing across different screen readers

## VI. Cross-Browser Compatibility

Emily Watson reported Safari-specific issues with biometric authentication, particularly related to WebAuthn implementation.

Olivia Martinez has set up a dedicated testing environment for Safari and is working on automated tests to catch browser-specific issues earlier.

Alex Rodriguez suggested implementing browser-specific fallbacks and offered to share research on potential approaches.

## VII. Task Assignment and Sprint Planning

### A. Story Point Estimation

1. Accessibility improvements: 8 points (Emily Watson)
2. Database partitioning changes: 13 points (Michael Kim)
3. UI updates for accessibility: 5 points (Liam Foster)
4. Service layer improvements for nutrition API: 8 points (Alex Rodriguez)

Total: 34 points

### B. Definition of Done Updates

1. Added explicit accessibility testing requirements:
   - Pass automated accessibility tests
   - Manual testing with at least two different screen readers
2. Included security scanning, especially for nutrition data handling

### C. Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies

1. Database performance (Owner: Michael Kim)
   - Mitigation: Implement detailed monitoring from day one
2. Browser compatibility (Owner: Emily Watson)
   - Mitigation: Allocate buffer time for unexpected issues, especially with Safari
3. Testing complexity (Owner: Olivia Martinez)
   - Mitigation: Develop comprehensive test cases for various connectivity scenarios
4. Security compliance (Owner: Alex Rodriguez)
   - Mitigation: Ensure encryption and data handling meet all compliance requirements
5. Accessibility compliance (Owner: Liam Foster)
   - Mitigation: Conduct regular accessibility audits throughout development

## VIII. Action Items and Next Steps

1. Michael Kim: Document the database partitioning strategy and share with the team before the conference
2. Emily Watson: Start accessibility improvements after dental appointment
3. Alex Rodriguez: Schedule technical sync with Michael to discuss service layer architecture
4. Olivia Martinez: Update test suite with new accessibility and cross-browser testing requirements by end of day tomorrow
5. Liam Foster: Finalize updated component designs with new color scheme and share with Emily today
6. Alex Rodriguez and Olivia Martinez: Schedule security scanning rules review for Thursday
7. Emily Watson and Liam Foster: Lead technical sync for component library updates on Friday morning
8. Michael Kim: Lead database performance review tomorrow afternoon
9. All team members: Update tasks in Jira before tomorrow's sprint planning

## IX. Additional Discussions

1. Branching Strategy:
   - Create feature branches for dashboard infrastructure, nutrition logging updates, and accessibility improvements
   - Set up branch protection rules for code review, especially for security-sensitive parts

2. Remote Participation:
   - Michael Kim will join daily standups remotely during the conference

3. Virtual Collaboration:
   - Liam Foster to share details on new tools for real-time design reviews in tomorrow's standup

4. Cross-browser Testing:
   - Olivia Martinez to set up a dedicated Slack channel for cross-browser testing issues
   - Implement automated notifications from the testing pipeline in the Slack channel

## X. Sprint Commitment and Prioritization

Final story point commitment: 42 points

Priority order:
1. Database partitioning implementation
2. Accessibility improvements
3. Nutrition logging feature completion
4. Cross-browser compatibility fixes

## XI. Meeting Wrap-up

Upcoming meetings confirmed:
- Daily standup: Tomorrow at 10 AM
- Technical sync for service layer architecture: Today at 2 PM
- Security scanning rules review: Thursday (time TBD)

Meeting adjourned at 12:45 PM
