## II. Database Partitioning Update (Michael Kim)

### Progress:
- Implemented hybrid partitioning strategy
  - Time-series partitioning for daily health metrics showing promising results
  - Achieved 40% reduction in query response times for large datasets

### Challenges:
- Potential bottleneck identified with hash partitioning for user profiles
  - May cause issues when scaling beyond 100,000 users

### Action Items:
- Michael to sync with Alex Rodriguez regarding the potential bottleneck
- Document findings and share before leaving for the conference (due: end of day tomorrow)

### Impact on Development:
- No immediate blocking of health metrics dashboard development
- Issues need addressing before production deployment

## III. Accessibility Improvements (Emily Watson & Liam Foster)

### Current Status:
- WCAG compliance at 87% (target: 95%)

### Progress:
- Focus on keyboard navigation improvements
- Liam created three new color palette options meeting contrast requirements

### Challenges:
- Color contrast issues in macro-nutrient charts not meeting AA standards
- Dynamic content updates not properly announced by screen readers

### Action Items:
- Emily to implement ARIA live regions for dynamic content
- Liam to share new color palette options with the team today
- Emily and Liam to update core components in the component library

## IV. Nutrition Logging Feature (Alex Rodriguez)

### Progress:
- Two-tier caching strategy implementation
  - Local cache working well for offline support
- NutriAPI Pro integration mostly complete

### Challenges:
- Edge cases with data synchronization during poor connectivity
- Needs to decide on retry strategy for failed API calls

### Action Items:
- Alex to coordinate with Michael on database optimization questions
- Implement queue system for failed API calls

## V. Test Suite Updates (Olivia Martinez)

### Progress:
- Expanded cross-browser testing configuration to capture Safari-specific issues
- Integrated automated accessibility tests into CI pipeline
- Set up detailed logging for new database partitioning tests

### Challenges:
