HealthTrack Pro Project - Daily Scrum Meeting
Date: 2024-07-09
Time: 10:00 AM
Participants: Sarah Chen (Scrum Master), Michael Kim, Alex Rodriguez, Emily Watson, Liam Foster, Olivia Martinez

I. Introduction and Meeting Start
Sarah Chen opened the meeting at 10 AM, emphasizing the importance of discussing blockers and dependencies. She highlighted Michael's upcoming conference attendance as a key consideration for the team's planning.

II. Database Partitioning Update (Michael Kim)
A. Hybrid Approach Implementation
   - Time-based partitioning for health metrics data showing positive results:
     • 40% reduction in query response times achieved
   - Potential bottleneck identified with hash partitioning for user profiles:
     • Issue arises when scaling beyond 100,000 users
     • Uneven distribution patterns observed in load testing

B. Technical Details:
   - Hash key distribution becoming problematic at scale
   - Some partitions experiencing significantly more traffic than others

C. Next Steps:
   - Michael has ideas for redistribution strategy
   - Plans to validate these ideas before attending the database conference next week

III. Frontend and Accessibility Progress (Emily Watson & Liam Foster)
A. ARIA Live Regions Implementation
   - Emily reported progress on implementing ARIA live regions for the dashboard
   - Challenges identified:
     • Inconsistent behavior across different screen readers, particularly in Safari
     • Dynamic updates not being announced consistently

B. Color Contrast Updates
   - Liam created three new color palette options for macro-nutrient charts
   - Current WCAG compliance: 87%
   - Goal: Improve compliance percentage with new color schemes

C. Safari-specific WebAuthn API Issues
   - Emily raised concerns about Safari's handling of the WebAuthn API
   - Biometric authentication flow behaving differently compared to Chrome and Firefox

D. Planned Actions:
   - Emily and Liam to review new color palettes between 11 AM and 12 PM
   - Team to address Safari-specific issues in a separate technical sync

IV. Testing and CI/CD Updates (Olivia Martinez)
A. Test Suite Improvements
   - Updates pushed to catch Safari-specific issues automatically
   - Comprehensive documentation of issues available in the development channel

B. Automated Accessibility Testing
   - Integrated into CI pipeline
   - Currently failing due to color contrast issues (to be addressed by Liam's updates)

C. Cross-browser Testing
   - Expanded configuration to capture Safari-specific issues
   - Focus on biometric authentication flow differences

V. Two-Factor Authentication and Offline Support (Alex Rodriguez & Michael Kim)
A. Two-tier Caching Strategy for Offline Support
   - Local cache performing well
   - Synchronization challenges identified:
     • Edge cases during poor connectivity causing issues
     • Need for a queue system to handle failed API calls

B. Queue System Implementation
   - Alex has started work on the queue system
   - Challenges:
     • Handling conflict resolution for queued operations
     • Maintaining correct order of operations

C. Memory Usage Concerns
   - Michael noticed concerning patterns in memory usage
   - Issues arise when local cache grows beyond certain thresholds
   - Need to establish clear boundaries for memory management

VI. Coordination and Knowledge Transfer
A. Michael's Conference Attendance (Next Thursday)
   - Knowledge transfer on partitioning strategy required
   - Scheduled review session with Alex at 2 PM today
   - Michael to document all database partitioning findings by end of day tomorrow

B. Service Layer Architecture Review
   - Scheduled for 2 PM between Michael and Alex
   - Topics to cover:
     • Database partitioning strategy
     • Memory implications of two-tier caching
     • Potential solutions for user profile bottleneck

VII. Component Library and Design Updates
A. Accessibility Improvements
   - Emily and Liam coordinating updates to existing components
   - Need to plan timing for pushing changes to avoid disrupting ongoing work

B. New Widget Prototypes
   - Liam designed new prototypes for health metrics dashboard
   - Optimized for both performance and accessibility
   - Require team validation before implementation

C. Automated Testing Integration
   - Olivia offered to include new components in automated test suite
   - Waiting for components to be ready for testing

VIII. Action Items and Follow-ups
A. Scheduled Meetings:
   1. Emily and Liam: Color palette review (11 AM - 12 PM today)
   2. Michael and Alex: Database review (2 PM today)
   3. Technical sync for Safari WebAuthn issues (Tomorrow morning, time TBD)

B. Documentation and Implementation Tasks:
   1. Michael: Document database partitioning findings (Due: End of day tomorrow)
   2. Alex: Start implementation of queue system for failed API calls
   3. Emily: Continue work on ARIA live regions, focusing on cross-browser consistency
   4. Liam: Prepare new color palettes for automated accessibility testing
   5. Olivia: Update test suite with new accessibility and cross-browser tests

C. Team Coordination:
   1. Coordinate timing for component library updates
   2. Plan for Michael's remote participation during conference

IX. Meeting Wrap-up
Sarah summarized key points and scheduled meetings, reminding the team to document decisions in respective Slack channels. The meeting concluded with a clear plan for addressing critical technical challenges and ensuring smooth progress despite upcoming schedule constraints.
