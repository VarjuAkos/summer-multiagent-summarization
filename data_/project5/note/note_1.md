# HealthTrack Pro Sprint Planning Meeting

Date: 2024-06-17
Attendees: Sarah Chen (Scrum Master), Alex Rodriguez, Emily Watson, Michael Kim, Olivia Martinez, Liam Foster

## I. Introduction and Check-in

Sarah Chen opened the meeting, welcoming the team to the initial sprint planning for HealthTrack Pro. Team members shared their current status:

- Emily Watson: Excited to start, has been sketching frontend component ideas.
- Alex Rodriguez: Ready to go, has been reviewing security protocols for health data management.
- Michael Kim: Prepared to discuss database structure thoughts.
- Olivia Martinez: Has set up initial test environments, wants to discuss CI/CD pipeline.
- Liam Foster: Has latest design mockups ready to share.

## II. Meeting Objectives

Sarah Chen outlined the meeting objectives:
1. Break down MVP requirements
2. Make technical architecture decisions
3. Establish sprint duration and velocity baseline
4. Define Definition of Done
5. Create initial sprint backlog

## III. Security Requirements Discussion

Alex Rodriguez raised the importance of security for handling health data. The team discussed balancing security with user experience:

- Emily Watson expressed concern about overly complicated authentication flows causing user drop-off.
- Alex Rodriguez emphasized the need for robust security, suggesting two-factor authentication and biometric authentication for mobile users.
- Liam Foster proposed making biometric auth optional but strongly encouraged, with UI designed to make it feel like a security feature.

Decision: Implement required two-factor authentication and optional biometric authentication, with Emily and Liam collaborating on a user-friendly flow.

## IV. Database and Backend Architecture

Michael Kim proposed using PostgreSQL for the database. The team agreed due to its ACID compliance and JSON capabilities.

Discussions included:
- Database schema for activity tracking, with consideration for different types of activities and data integrity.
- Alex Rodriguez suggested partitioning activity data by date ranges for query performance optimization.
- The team agreed to implement JSON Schema validation for data validation.

Michael Kim will create a schema design that includes:
- Flexible structure for different activity types
- Partitioning for optimized query performance
- Support for data validation using JSON Schema

## V. Frontend Architecture and State Management

Emily Watson presented a modular dashboard layout with individual widgets for different health metrics. Liam Foster shared widget designs with consistent styling and clear data visualization patterns.

State management discussion:
- Alex Rodriguez suggested using Redux with Redux Toolkit for scalability.
- Emily Watson proposed using React Query for server state and Context for simpler UI state management.
- After weighing pros and cons, including testing considerations raised by Olivia Martinez, the team decided to use Redux with Redux Toolkit.

## VI. Sprint Duration and Velocity

The team agreed on two-week sprints, with considerations:
- Olivia Martinez requested at least two days at the end of each sprint for QA.
- Alex Rodriguez suggested being conservative with initial velocity estimates due to the new team and project.

## VII. Definition of Done

The team established the following Definition of Done criteria:
1. Code review completion
2. Unit tests with at least 80% coverage
3. Integration tests for critical paths
4. Successful deployment to staging
5. No critical or high-priority bugs
6. API documentation (added by Michael Kim)
7. Accessibility testing to WCAG 2.1 AA standards (added by Liam Foster)
8. Security testing (added by Alex Rodriguez)

## VIII. Sprint Backlog Creation

The team prioritized the following high-priority items:
1. User authentication
2. Basic database structure for user profiles
3. Basic dashboard structure and activity input forms

Detailed breakdown for user authentication:
- Security requirements: secure password hashing, rate limiting for login attempts, JWT token management with proper expiration, and secure session handling.
- Backend implementation (Michael Kim): 3 days, including testing
- Frontend implementation (Emily Watson): 4 days, including error handling and UI components
- UI design (Liam Foster): 1 day for authentication flow designs

## IX. User Profile Functionality

- Michael Kim estimated 5 days for backend implementation of the profile system.
- Emily Watson estimated 4 days for frontend implementation, including forms and validation.
- Liam Foster presented a stepped form approach for profile editing to avoid overwhelming users.
- Alex Rodriguez added a day for implementing field-level encryption for sensitive health information.
- The team decided to store data in standardized units and handle conversion in the application layer to support international formats.

## X. Activity Tracking Features

- Liam Foster presented user research showing preference for both quick input and detailed logging.
- Emily Watson proposed implementing a quick-add feature for common activities and a detailed form for specific entries.
- The team discussed data integrity concerns and decided on a 30-day window for user modifications, with support contact required for older entries.
- Liam Foster will design UI elements to show edit status, including a lock icon for non-editable entries.

## XI. Nutrition Logging Feature

- The team debated between building their own food database and integrating with an existing API.
- Decision: Start with a third-party API but implement robust caching and offline support.
- Emily Watson raised concerns about user experience if the API is slow or down.
- Liam Foster suggested implementing offline capability and caching for commonly used foods.
- Olivia Martinez will set up a test environment simulating various API response scenarios.
- Alex Rodriguez will research API options and prepare a comparison by the next day.

## XII. Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies

The team identified and discussed the following risks:
1. Testing infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines (Olivia Martinez)
2. Security implications of the third-party nutrition API (Alex Rodriguez)
3. Database performance with real user data (Michael Kim)
4. Browser compatibility for complex UI features (Emily Watson)
5. Accessibility across different screen readers and assistive technologies (Liam Foster)

Mitigation strategies:
- Olivia Martinez will spend three days setting up the basic CI/CD pipeline.
- Alex Rodriguez will work with Olivia on security requirements for the pipeline, including code scanning and secrets detection.
- Michael Kim will set up Grafana dashboards for database monitoring.
- Emily Watson will set up cross-browser testing with BrowserStack, supporting the last two major versions of each major browser.
- Olivia Martinez will add browser compatibility checks to the automated testing suite and implement visual regression testing.

## XIII. Sprint Schedule and Final Decisions

- Sprint start date: Wednesday (two days from the meeting)
- First demo: Two weeks from Thursday
- Sprint duration: Two weeks
- Key decisions recap:
  1. Two-week sprints with demos on Thursdays
  2. PostgreSQL for database with partitioning for activity data
  3. Redux for state management
  4. Two-factor auth with optional biometric
  5. Third-party nutrition API with local caching
  6. Browser support for last two major versions
  7. WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for accessibility

## XIV. Closing Remarks and Next Steps

- Technical sync scheduled for 10 AM the next day to discuss authentication implementation details
- Design review for dashboard components scheduled for Thursday morning
- Olivia Martinez requested SSH keys from all team members by end of day
- Michael Kim to share proposed database schema documentation for review before the technical sync
- Sarah Chen to send out meeting notes and action items within the next hour
