# HealthTrack Pro Daily Scrum Meeting - July 12, 2024

## I. Introduction and Opening

Sarah Chen, the Scrum Master and Project Manager, opened the meeting at 10:00 AM, acknowledging two pressing matters:
1. Safari WebAuthn implementation issues
2. Michael Kim's upcoming conference attendance

Sarah emphasized the need to address these issues promptly to maintain the project's momentum and meet Sprint 2 goals.

## II. Safari WebAuthn Implementation Issues

### A. Emily Watson's Findings
Emily Watson, the Frontend Developer, reported significant differences in Safari's WebAuthn implementation compared to Chrome and Firefox:
- Inconsistent behavior in triggering biometric prompts
- Error handling issues specific to Safari
- Safari's WebAuthn API treats authentication prompts differently, particularly in the user verification flow

### B. Alex Rodriguez's Input
Alex Rodriguez, the Senior Full-Stack Developer, provided additional insights:
- Identified Safari's more restrictive security model
- Discovered an undocumented requirement for an additional user gesture before triggering the biometric prompt
- Proposed a fallback solution involving:
  - Detecting Safari specifically
  - Implementing an intermediate confirmation step

### C. Accessibility Concerns
Emily Watson highlighted accessibility issues related to the WebAuthn implementation:
- Inconsistent screen reader announcements across different Safari versions and VoiceOver
- ARIA live regions for dashboard real-time updates are not behaving consistently, particularly in Safari

### D. Backend Considerations
Michael Kim, the Backend Developer, raised concerns about the impact on the token validation flow:
- Potential delays from additional confirmation steps could affect current token management system
- Alex suggested extending the token expiration grace period specifically for Safari
- Proposal for implementing a browser-specific configuration for token lifetime

## III. Database Partitioning Documentation

### A. Michael Kim's Update
Michael reported on the progress of the database partitioning strategy:
- Documentation is 80% complete
- Hybrid partitioning strategy detailed, combining time-based partitioning for health metrics data and hash partitioning for user profiles
- 40% reduction in query response times observed
- Potential bottleneck identified for user profiles when scaling beyond 100,000 users

### B. Olivia Martinez's Observations
Olivia Martinez, the QA Engineer and DevOps Specialist, shared insights from the test environment:
- Promising results overall with the new partitioning strategy
- Uneven distribution patterns detected in certain partition ranges

### C. Action Items
- Michael to adjust the hash function before his conference attendance
- Michael is working on a modified hash function for better distribution and will share implementation details after the meeting

## IV. Accessibility Improvements

### A. Liam Foster's Progress
Liam Foster, the UI/UX Designer, reported on accessibility enhancements:
- Created three new color palette options for macro-nutrient charts, all WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- Improved keyboard navigation patterns for the dashboard

### B. Emily Watson's Work
Emily provided an update on her accessibility-related tasks:
- Implementing ARIA live regions for dashboard real-time updates
- Facing challenges with screen reader behavior, especially in Safari

### C. WCAG Compliance
- Current WCAG compliance: 87%
- Team aiming for 95% compliance

### D. Focus Management
Alex Rodriguez proposed adjustments to focus management:
- Need to adapt approach for Safari WebAuthn fallback
- Suggested implementing a focus trap manager specifically for the authentication flow

## V. Action Items and Next Steps

1. Emily Watson and Alex Rodriguez:
   - Schedule technical sync for 2 PM today to finalize Safari fallback approach
   - Bring documentation on screen reader behavior patterns (Emily)
   - Set up testing environment with different Safari versions (Alex)

2. Michael Kim:
   - Complete partitioning documentation by tomorrow
   - Share modified hash function implementation details after the meeting
   - Available for one-on-one with Sarah after lunch to review documentation

3. Liam Foster:
   - Circulate new color palettes for team review

4. Alex Rodriguez:
   - Contact security team regarding token lifetime adjustments for Safari

5. Olivia Martinez:
   - Set up dedicated Grafana dashboard for partition metrics
   - Implement alerts for distribution skews above 15%

6. Sarah Chen:
   - Schedule one-on-one with Michael for documentation review

## VI. Closing

Sarah Chen summarized the action items and encouraged the team to maintain momentum on the current improvements. She emphasized the importance of completing critical tasks before Michael's conference attendance next week.

## Technical Details

1. Safari WebAuthn Implementation:
   - Requires additional user gesture before biometric prompt
   - Inconsistent behavior in triggering biometric prompts
   - Error handling differences compared to Chrome and Firefox
   - Proposed fallback: Intermediate confirmation step for Safari

2. Database Partitioning:
   - Hybrid strategy: Time-based for health metrics, hash-based for user profiles
   - 40% reduction in query response times
   - Potential bottleneck at 100,000+ users
   - Uneven distribution in certain partition ranges

3. Accessibility Improvements:
   - New WCAG 2.1 AA compliant color palettes for charts
   - ARIA live regions implementation for real-time updates
   - Focus trap manager proposed for authentication flow
   - Current WCAG compliance: 87%, target: 95%

4. Token Validation:
   - Proposal to extend token expiration grace period for Safari
   - Consideration of browser-specific token lifetime configuration
