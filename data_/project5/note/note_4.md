# HealthTrack Pro - Daily Scrum Meeting Note
Date: 2024-06-20
Time: 10:00 AM
Focus: Technical Design Review (Authentication and Accessibility)

## I. Introduction and Meeting Focus

Sarah Chen opened the meeting at 10 AM, emphasizing the focus on technical design review aspects, particularly authentication and accessibility. This aligns with the current sprint goals and the upcoming design review scheduled for 2 PM today.

## II. Authentication Flow Dry Run Results

### A. Safari Compatibility Issues
Emily Watson and Liam Foster reported findings from their authentication flow dry run:
- Inconsistent behavior across Safari versions for biometric authentication
- Complete failure in Safari versions older than 15.4
- Affects approximately 12% of potential user base

### B. UI and Accessibility Concerns
Liam Foster highlighted:
- Solid UI components overall
- Color contrast issues in the biometric prompt, not meeting WCAG standards
- Prepared alternative designs to improve accessibility while maintaining visual hierarchy

### C. Proposed Solution
Alex Rodriguez suggested:
- Implement a progressive enhancement approach
- Detect Safari's WebAuthn support level before initializing biometric prompt
- Prepared code examples to share with the team

## III. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

### A. Error Handling
Michael Kim provided updates on 2FA error code documentation:
- Mapped out all possible error states and corresponding codes
- Identified challenge: handling edge cases where 2FA token expires during authentication
- Proposed solution: Implement a 30-second grace period for expired tokens

### B. UI Implementation
Emily Watson suggested:
- Add a countdown timer in the UI when within 30 seconds of token expiration
- Addresses issue of users being abruptly logged out

### C. Accessibility Considerations
Liam Foster presented:
- Mockups for countdown timer UI
- Ensured accessibility for screen readers
- Included appropriate ARIA live regions for real-time updates

## IV. Accessibility Compliance

### A. Current Status
Olivia Martinez reported on automated accessibility tests:
- Overall 87% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Main issues identified:
  1. Color contrast in the biometric prompt
  2. Missing ARIA labels in activity input forms
  3. Keyboard navigation issues in the 2FA flow

### B. Proposed Solutions
1. Liam Foster:
   - Prepared updated color palette meeting AA standards while maintaining brand identity
   - Will address color contrast issues immediately

2. Emily Watson:
   - Working on improving keyboard navigation
   - Challenge: Handling focus states when switching between authentication methods

3. Alex Rodriguez:
   - Suggested implementing a focus trap manager
   - Would automatically handle focus states based on authentication context
   - Offered to share similar code from a previous project

## V. Security Concerns

### A. NutriAPI Integration Issues
Olivia Martinez identified security concerns with the nutrition API responses:
1. Unescaped HTML in food description fields
2. Sensitive user data in error messages
3. Potential SQL injection vectors in query parameters

### B. Proposed Solutions
1. Alex Rodriguez:
   - Implement sanitization layer before data reaches frontend
   - Sanitize at the boundary, not just at display level
   - Suggested creating a whitelist for common food-related terms to reduce false positives in PII detection
   - Recommended implementing rate limiting on API calls to prevent potential DOS attacks

2. Michael Kim:
   - Will add validation middleware to check for security patterns before data reaches application logic
   - Implemented caching layer to reduce API calls by approximately 60% during peak usage
   - Added staleness checker to force refresh if data is more than 15 minutes old

3. Olivia Martinez:
   - Set up initial security scanning pipeline for nutrition API responses
   - Configured Jenkins to flag responses containing potential PII

### C. Data Freshness UI
Liam Foster suggested adding a subtle indicator in the UI to show when data was last updated.

## VI. Fallback Authentication Flow

### A. Current Issues
Emily Watson raised concerns about the user experience when transitioning from biometric to password-based 2FA.

### B. UI Improvements
Liam Foster presented sketches for improved fallback flow:
- Clear visual indicator when switching authentication methods
- Animated transition and explicit messaging about the reason for the switch

### C. Performance Considerations
Emily Watson suggested adding a `prefers-reduced-motion` media query check to address potential performance issues on lower-end devices.

## VII. Error Handling Standardization

### A. Current Issues
Michael Kim and Emily Watson noted inconsistencies in error messaging between frontend and backend.

### B. Proposed Solution
Michael Kim presented an error categorization system:
- Four main categories: authentication failures, validation errors, network issues, and system errors
- Each category has specific error codes and user-friendly message templates
- Included localization keys for each message

### C. Implementation Plan
Team agreed to focus on core functionality for now and address localization in a future sprint.

## VIII. Preparation for Design Review (2 PM)

1. Emily Watson and Liam Foster to prepare a demo of the authentication flow
   - Emily to focus on happy path and error states
   - Liam to prepare screenshots of accessibility improvements

2. Alex Rodriguez to send out WebAuthn implementation guide within the next hour

3. All team members to review their components for accessibility compliance before the review

## IX. Blockers and Dependencies

1. Emily Watson: Needs Alex's input on WebAuthn approach to finalize authentication flow
2. Alex Rodriguez: Needs Olivia's final security scanning rules to complete API integration
3. Michael Kim: No major blockers, but wants to pair with Alex on encryption key rotation implementation
4. Liam Foster: Needs Emily's sign-off on updated color scheme before updating design system documentation
5. Olivia Martinez: Blocked on implementing some security tests pending Alex's API response validation patterns

## X. Action Items

1. Alex Rodriguez:
   - Share WebAuthn implementation guide within the next hour
   - Review Olivia's configured security scanning rules
   - Provide API response validation patterns to Olivia
   - Share focus trap manager code with Emily

2. Emily Watson:
   - Implement `prefers-reduced-motion` check for authentication method switch animation
   - Sign off on Liam's updated color scheme
   - Prepare authentication flow demo focusing on happy path and error states

3. Michael Kim:
   - Pair with Alex on encryption key rotation implementation
   - Implement validation middleware for API response security checks

4. Liam Foster:
   - Update color scheme for biometric prompt to meet WCAG standards
   - Prepare screenshots of accessibility improvements for design review
   - Update design system documentation after Emily's sign-off

5. Olivia Martinez:
   - Fine-tune security scanning rules with Alex's input
   - Add Emily's `prefers-reduced-motion` check to test matrix

6. All team members:
   - Review components for accessibility compliance before 2 PM design review
   - Update tasks in Jira

## XI. Next Steps

1. Design review scheduled for 2 PM today
2. Continue work on sprint goals:
   - Implement user authentication system
   - Develop basic database structure for user profiles
   - Create basic dashboard structure and activity input forms

3. Address identified security and accessibility issues
4. Prepare for next sprint planning on 2024-07-03
