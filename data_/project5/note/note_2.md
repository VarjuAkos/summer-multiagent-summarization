- Finalizing database schema documentation
  - Completed partitioning strategy for activity data
  - Added detailed comments on flexible structure for activity types

#### Action Items:
- Complete database schema documentation by early afternoon
  - Include specific validation rules for nutrition data
- Discuss encryption key rotation strategy with Alex during technical sync
- Review and potentially adjust salt generation method for password hashing

### C. Alex Rodriguez (Senior Full-Stack Developer)

#### Completed Tasks:
- Nutrition API research
  - Compared three potential providers
  - Recommends NutriAPI Pro due to offline caching support and competitive pricing
- Reviewed Michael's encryption approach
  - Identified potential security concern with salt generation method

#### Action Items:
- Share detailed API analysis after the stand-up
- Submit SSH key to Olivia by noon
- Sync with Michael on database partitioning impact on nutrition data caching
- Share encryption key rotation strategy documentation before technical sync
- Help Olivia set up security scanning rules for nutrition API responses
- Discuss field-level encryption implementation with Michael

### D. Olivia Martinez (QA Engineer / DevOps Specialist)

#### Progress:
- Started setting up initial CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Integrated security scanning into the pipeline

#### Reminders:
- SSH key submissions due by noon (Alex and Liam still pending)

#### Challenges:
- Additional configuration needed for scanning nutrition API responses

#### Action Items:
- Collect remaining SSH keys from team members
- Work with Alex on setting up security rules for nutrition data endpoints

### E. Liam Foster (UI/UX Designer)

#### Progress:
- Collaborated with Emily on authentication flow UI
- Made adjustments for 2FA screen accessibility

#### Concerns:
- Color contrast issues on biometric authentication prompt

#### Action Items:
- Submit SSH key to Olivia by noon
- Schedule sync with Emily to review contrast ratios
- Update Figma prototypes for Thursday's design review
- Prepare authentication flow demo with Emily
- Update design system documentation with meeting decisions

## III. Discussion of Blockers and Challenges

1. Database partitioning impact on user activity logs and nutrition data caching
   - Michael and Alex to sync on this issue
   - Potential impact on how nutrition data is cached, especially for offline support

2. Potential security concern with password hashing method
   - Alex identified issue during review
   - Michael to adjust salt generation method

3. Need for API endpoint clarification for 2FA
   - Emily and Michael to sync on this

4. Additional configuration required for security scanning of nutrition API responses
   - Olivia and Alex to collaborate on setting up correct rules

5. Color contrast issues on biometric authentication prompt
   - Liam and Emily to review and adjust

## IV. Upcoming Meetings and Deadlines

### A. Technical sync meeting at 10 AM
- To discuss blockers and technical issues in depth
- Alex to share encryption key rotation strategy
- Michael and Alex to discuss database partitioning impact on activity logs and nutrition data caching

### B. Design review on Thursday (2024-06-20)
- Emily and Liam to prepare authentication flow demo

### C. Today's deadlines (2024-06-19)
- SSH key submissions to Olivia by noon
- Alex to provide API comparison documentation
- Michael to complete database schema documentation by early afternoon

## V. Additional Technical Discussions

1. Database Structure:
   - Michael implemented partitioning strategy for activity data
   - Flexible structure for different activity types
   - Potential impact on user activity logs and nutrition data caching

2. Authentication System:
   - Two-factor authentication (2FA) implementation in progress
   - Biometric authentication integration facing browser compatibility issues
   - JWT token management and secure session handling being implemented

3. Security Measures:
   - Secure password hashing with potential adjustment needed for salt generation
   - Rate limiting for login attempts implemented
   - Field-level encryption for sensitive health information to be reviewed

4. Nutrition API Integration:
   - Alex recommends NutriAPI Pro for robust offline caching support and competitive pricing
   - Need to implement data sanitization rules for nutrition data endpoints

5. CI/CD Pipeline:
   - Initial configuration set up with security scanning integration
   - Additional configuration needed for scanning nutrition API responses

6. Accessibility:
   - Adjustments made to 2FA screens for improved screen reader compatibility
