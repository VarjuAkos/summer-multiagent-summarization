# HealthTrack Pro Daily Scrum Meeting - July 11, 2024

## I. Introduction and Meeting Start

Sarah Chen, Project Manager and Scrum Master, opened the meeting, emphasizing critical items to be addressed, particularly in light of Michael Kim's upcoming conference attendance.

## II. Database Partitioning Documentation (Michael Kim)

### A. Documentation Progress
- 80% completion of hybrid partitioning strategy documentation

### B. Implementation Results
- 40% reduction in query response times for time-series health metrics data

### C. Identified Bottleneck
- Hash partitioning approach for user profiles beyond 100,000 users
- Uneven distribution patterns in certain partition ranges, particularly when users are created within similar time windows

### D. Proposed Solutions
- Three potential approaches documented in technical specs
- Plan to adjust hash function to include additional attributes beyond user ID
- Michael needs about two more hours to finalize the redistribution strategy documentation

### E. Action Items
- Michael and Alex to discuss database implications during 2 PM technical sync
- Michael to complete documentation before conference attendance
- Olivia to set up additional Grafana dashboards for monitoring partition distribution metrics

## III. WCAG Compliance Progress (Emily Watson & Liam Foster)

### A. Current Status
- 87% WCAG compliant, working towards 95% target

### B. Challenges
1. ARIA live regions implementation inconsistencies across screen readers
2. Safari-specific issues, particularly with WebAuthn API in biometric authentication flow
3. Color contrast issues in macro-nutrient charts

### C. Progress and Solutions
- Emily implemented a workaround for VoiceOver on Safari, but it's not a permanent solution
- Liam created three new color palette options meeting WCAG 2.1 AA requirements

### D. Action Items
- Emily and Liam to review new color palette options after the Safari WebAuthn technical sync
- Address Safari WebAuthn API issues in a dedicated technical sync tomorrow morning
- Refine component library update strategy for health metrics dashboard to better handle real-time updates while maintaining accessibility

## IV. Nutrition Logging Feature (Alex Rodriguez)

### A. Queue System Implementation
- Completed initial architecture for handling failed API calls during poor connectivity
- Includes automatic retry logic and error handling

### B. Challenges
- Integration with two-tier caching strategy
- Local cache growth patterns require more aggressive cleanup strategy

### C. Proposed Solutions
- Potential adaptation of hybrid partitioning strategy for queue system's persistent storage
- Implement more aggressive cleanup strategy for offline data

### D. Action Items
- Alex and Michael to discuss database implications during 2 PM technical sync
- Alex to finalize queue system architecture after the technical sync
- Implement and test aggressive cleanup strategy for offline data

## V. Testing and Monitoring (Olivia Martinez)

### A. Automated Testing
- Expanded testing configuration to capture Safari-specific issues consistently
- Automated accessibility tests integrated into CI pipeline

### B. Monitoring
- Set up monitoring alerts for memory usage spikes
- Offer to help test cache cleanup strategy

### C. Action Items
- Set up additional Grafana dashboards for partitioning strategy monitoring before Michael's conference
- Extend monitoring to track cache-related metrics specifically
- Create dedicated Slack channel for cross-browser testing issues
- Update test suite with new accessibility and cross-browser tests

## VI. Critical Items and Blockers

### A. Database Partitioning (Michael Kim)
- Needs two more hours to finalize redistribution strategy documentation
- Potential bottleneck with hash partitioning for user profiles beyond 100,000 users

### B. Safari Compatibility (Emily Watson)
- WebAuthn API behaving differently in Safari compared to Chrome and Firefox
- Main blocker for biometric authentication flow

### C. Queue System Architecture (Alex Rodriguez)
- Finalization pending technical sync with Michael

### D. Color Palette Review (Liam Foster)
- Needs Emily's input to move forward with component library updates

### E. Security Scanning Rules (Olivia Martinez)
- Waiting on final rules for nutrition API responses to complete test suite updates

## VII. Action Items and Next Steps

1. Schedule Safari WebAuthn technical sync for tomorrow morning (Sarah)
2. Michael and Alex to have technical sync at 2 PM today
3. Emily and Liam to review color palettes after WebAuthn sync
4. Olivia to set up additional monitoring dashboards for partitioning strategy
5. Create dedicated Slack channel for cross-browser testing issues (Olivia)
6. Sarah to briefly attend 2 PM technical sync
7. Michael to complete database partitioning documentation before conference
8. Alex to implement queue system for failed API calls
9. Emily and Liam to continue work on ARIA live regions and color contrast fixes
10. Team to implement browser-specific fallbacks for Safari WebAuthn API issues

## VIII. Team Availability and Schedule Notes

- Michael Kim attending database conference next Thursday (available remotely for critical discussions)
- Emily Watson has dental appointments next Tuesday afternoon
- Sarah to account for Emily's absence in next week's planning

## IX. Meeting Wrap-up

### A. Main Priorities Recap
1. Complete database documentation before Michael's conference attendance
2. Address Safari compatibility issues, especially for WebAuthn API
3. Move forward with accessibility improvements to reach 95% WCAG compliance target

### B. Follow-up Instructions
- Team to follow up on respective action items
- Reminder about 2 PM technical sync for Michael and Alex
- Utilize backup communication channel for reaching Michael during the conference if needed
