# HealthTrack Pro Daily Scrum Meeting Note
Date: 2024-06-19
Time: 10:00 AM
Type: Daily Scrum with Technical Discussion

## I. Introduction and Context

Sarah Chen (Scrum Master/Project Manager) opened the meeting, reminding the team of the upcoming design review scheduled for tomorrow (2024-06-20). She emphasized the need for alignment on the authentication flow, which is a critical component of the HealthTrack Pro MVP.

## II. Status Updates

### A. Emily Watson (Frontend Developer)
1. Progress: 60% completion of frontend authentication components
2. Completed: Login form with validation and error handling
3. In Progress: 2FA UI components
4. Challenges:
   - Biometric authentication facing browser compatibility issues, particularly in Safari
   - Inconsistencies between API documentation and actual responses for 2FA
5. Next Steps: Sync with Michael Kim regarding API endpoints

### B. Michael Kim (Backend Developer)
1. Completed:
   - Secure password hashing implementation
   - Rate limiting for login attempts
2. Nearly Complete: JWT token management
3. In Progress: Session handling
4. Under Review: Salt generation method for potential security implications

### C. Alex Rodriguez (Senior Full-Stack Developer)
1. Completed: Detailed analysis of NutriAPI Pro integration
2. Concerns:
   - Security implications of the nutrition API integration
   - Data validation for nutrition information
3. In Progress: Field-level encryption implementation for sensitive health data

### D. Olivia Martinez (QA Engineer / DevOps Specialist)
1. Completed: Initial CI/CD pipeline configuration with security scanning integration
2. In Progress:
   - Setting up security scanning rules for nutrition API responses
   - Collecting SSH keys from team members (Alex and Liam outstanding)

### E. Liam Foster (UI/UX Designer)
1. Completed:
   - Collaboration with Emily on authentication flow UI
   - Adjustments to improve 2FA screen accessibility
   - Updates to Figma prototypes
2. Identified: Color contrast issues in the biometric authentication prompt

## III. Detailed Technical Discussions

### A. Salt Generation for Password Hashing
1. Current Implementation:
   - Uses timestamp-based seed for salt generation
2. Concerns:
   - Potential vulnerability if attackers can predict the timestamp pattern
3. Proposed Solution:
   - Switch to crypto.randomBytes() for salt generation
4. Decision:
   - Team agreed to implement the proposed solution due to enhanced security with negligible performance impact

### B. 2FA API Endpoint Structure
1. Issue:
   - Inconsistencies between documented and actual API responses
2. Changes Made:
   - Michael adjusted error response format to include more detailed error codes for different types of 2FA failures
3. Action Items:
   - Michael to share updated documentation by end of day (2024-06-19)
   - Emily to update frontend error handling logic based on new documentation

### C. Biometric Authentication Browser Compatibility
1. Main Issue:
   - Safari's implementation of WebAuthn API differs from Chrome and Firefox
   - Intermittent failures during verification process
   - Inconsistent error messages across browsers
2. Proposed Solutions:
   - Olivia offered cross-browser testing support using BrowserStack
   - Liam designed fallback UI states for graceful error handling
   - Alex to share code snippets for feature detection instead of browser detection
3. Action Items:
   - Emily to provide test scenarios to Olivia for cross-browser testing
   - Emily and Liam to review fallback UI states
   - Alex to share WebAuthn implementation suggestions with Emily

### D. Security Infrastructure
1. SSH Key Collection:
   - Olivia waiting on keys from Alex and Liam (due by noon, 2024-06-19)
2. Security Scanning Rules:
   - Alex to provide input on specific patterns for nutrition API response scanning
3. Encryption Key Rotation Strategy:
   - Alex proposed:
     - 30-day automatic rotation
     - 24-hour overlap period to prevent service disruptions
     - Maintain three generations of keys in rotation
4. Action Item:
   - Michael and Alex to sync on encryption key rotation implementation details

### E. Accessibility Concerns
1. Issues Identified:
   - Error messages in 2FA flow not properly announced by screen readers
   - ARIA attributes need proper setup, especially for dynamic content
2. Action Items:
   - Liam to update design system documentation with proper ARIA labels and roles
   - Emily and Liam to address accessibility concerns before tomorrow's design review

## IV. Preparation for Design Review (2024-06-20)

1. Authentication Flow Demo:
   - Emily and Liam to conduct a dry run this afternoon
   - Will incorporate Alex's WebAuthn suggestions
2. Figma Prototypes:
   - Liam has prepared updated prototypes showing both happy path and error states
3. Action Item:
   - Emily and Liam to conduct authentication flow dry run this afternoon

## V. Action Items Summary

1. Michael Kim:
   - Share updated 2FA error code documentation by EOD (2024-06-19)
   - Sync with Alex on encryption key rotation implementation details
2. Alex Rodriguez:
   - Submit SSH key to Olivia by noon (2024-06-19)
   - Share WebAuthn implementation suggestions with Emily
   - Provide input on security scanning rules for nutrition API responses to Olivia
