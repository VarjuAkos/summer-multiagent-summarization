# HealthTrack Pro Daily Scrum Meeting - 2024-07-12, 10:00 AM

## I. Introduction and Opening

Sarah Chen, Project Manager and Scrum Master, opened the meeting at 10 AM, emphasizing critical items to be discussed, particularly in light of Michael Kim's upcoming conference attendance next week.

## II. Safari WebAuthn Implementation

### A. Emily Watson's Update
- Conducted a technical sync with Alex about Safari authentication issues
- Proposed solution: Implement an intermediate confirmation step specifically for Safari users
- Challenge: Inconsistent WebAuthn API behavior across different Safari versions

### B. Alex Rodriguez's Input
- Developed a Safari-specific detection method
- Proposed extending token expiration grace period to 30 seconds for Safari users
- Requested feedback on security implications of the proposed changes

### C. Michael Kim's Security Perspective
- Deemed the extended grace period acceptable with proper rate limiting
- Suggested implementing a queue system for failed authentication attempts

### D. Alex's Response to Security Concerns
- Confirmed implementation of a Redis-based queue with exponential backoff
- Expressed concern about the impact on user experience during poor connectivity scenarios

### E. Emily's User Experience Considerations
- Added visual indicators for the authentication process
- Implemented ARIA announcements for screen readers to maintain accessibility

## III. WCAG Compliance Improvements

### A. Current Status
- WCAG compliance currently at 87%, working towards 95% target

### B. Liam Foster's Update
- Created three new color palette options for macro-nutrient charts, meeting WCAG 2.1 AA requirements
- Ongoing collaboration with Emily on ARIA live regions implementation
- Issue: Inconsistent behavior across different screen readers, especially in Safari

### C. Emily's Input on Accessibility Challenges
- VoiceOver on Safari handles dynamic content updates differently than NVDA or JAWS
- Implemented a workaround using aria-atomic attributes, but not ideal
- Identified focus management issues during the authentication flow

## IV. Database Partitioning Documentation

### A. Michael Kim's Progress Update
- Documentation is 80% complete
- Hybrid partitioning strategy showing promising results: 40% reduction in query response times
- Potential bottleneck identified for user profiles beyond 100,000 users

### B. Olivia Martinez's Monitoring Insights
- Observed uneven distribution in certain partition ranges

### C. Michael's Response and Action Items
- Modified hash function to address distribution issues
- Plans to review changes with Alex and document implementation details before conference
- Set up Grafana dashboards for monitoring partition metrics

## V. Coordination During Michael's Conference Absence

### A. Michael's Availability and Preparation
- Will be available remotely for daily standups
- Prepared detailed documentation for likely scenarios

### B. Alex's Role in Handling Database Concerns
- Capable of handling most issues in Michael's absence
- Agreement to postpone major schema changes until Michael's return

## VI. Two-Tier Caching Implementation

### A. Emily's Update
- Local cache working well for offline support
- Unexpected growth patterns observed in local cache
- Implemented cleanup strategy, may need threshold adjustments

### B. Liam's UI Work
- Added visual cues to show last data sync time
- Plans to share new designs with the team after the meeting

## VII. Testing Infrastructure Updates

### A. Olivia's Progress
- Expanded testing configuration to consistently capture Safari-specific issues
- Setting up a dedicated Slack channel for cross-browser testing reports
- Integrated automated accessibility tests into CI pipeline
- Working on implementing alerts for partition distribution skews above 15%

## VIII. Closing Notes and Additional Items

### A. Schedule Reminders
- Emily has a dental appointment on Tuesday afternoon next week
- Michael will be attending remotely next week due to the conference

### B. Alex's Security Team Consultation
- Plans to discuss token lifetime adjustments for Safari with the security team
- Expected to provide an update by the next standup

## IX. Meeting Conclusion

Sarah provided final remarks, encouraging the team to maintain momentum. She also scheduled a post-lunch sync with Michael for a detailed review of the database partitioning documentation.
