    "transcript": "[Sarah Chen] Good morning everyone! Let's get started with our Daily Scrum. I know we have some pressing matters to discuss today, especially around the Safari WebAuthn implementation and Michael's upcoming conference attendance. Emily, would you like to start with your findings on the Safari issues?\n\n[Emily Watson] Thanks, Sarah. Yes, so we've been diving deep into the Safari WebAuthn behavior, and we've uncovered some significant differences compared to Chrome and Firefox. The main issue is that Safari's implementation of the WebAuthn API is treating our authentication prompts differently, particularly in how it handles the user verification flow. We're seeing inconsistent behavior where Safari sometimes fails to properly trigger the biometric prompt, and when it does, the error handling isn't as graceful as in other browsers.\n\n[Alex Rodriguez] If I can jump in here - I've been working closely with Emily on this, and we've identified that Safari's security model is more restrictive. The main challenge is that it's requiring an additional user gesture before triggering the biometric prompt, which isn't documented in their API specs. I've drafted a potential fallback solution that involves detecting Safari specifically and implementing a intermediate confirmation step.\n\n[Emily Watson] Exactly, Alex. And what's particularly concerning is how this affects our accessibility implementations. The screen reader announcements for the authentication prompts are behaving inconsistently across different combinations of Safari versions and VoiceOver.\n\n[Michael Kim] Have you considered how this might impact the token validation flow on the backend? We need to ensure our current token management system can handle any potential delays from these additional confirmation steps.\n\n[Alex Rodriguez] Good point, Michael. I've actually been testing with our current token implementation, and we might need to extend the grace period for token expiration in Safari specifically. I'm thinking we could implement a browser-specific configuration for token lifetime.\n\n[Sarah Chen] How would that affect our security requirements? And Michael, before we go deeper into that, could you give us an update on the database partitioning documentation? I want to ensure we have everything properly documented before your conference next week.\n\n[Michael Kim] Right, so the documentation is about 80% complete. I've finished detailing the hybrid partitioning strategy implementation, including the time-based partitioning for our health metrics data. The good news is we're seeing about a 40% reduction in query response times. However, I've identified a potential bottleneck with the hash partitioning approach for user profiles when we scale beyond 100,000 users.\n\n[Olivia Martinez] I've been monitoring the test environment with the new partitioning strategy, and the results are promising. However, I'm seeing some uneven distribution patterns in certain partition ranges. Michael, should we adjust the hash function before you leave for the conference?\n\n[Michael Kim] Yes, I think that would be wise. I've actually started working on a modified hash function that should provide better distribution. I can share the implementation details after this meeting.\n\n[Liam Foster] While we're discussing implementations, I'd like to share some progress on the accessibility front. I've created three new color palette options for the macro-nutrient charts that meet WCAG 2.1 AA requirements. They all maintain good contrast ratios while still being visually appealing.\n\n[Emily Watson] That's great, Liam. I've been working on implementing ARIA live regions for the dashboard's real-time updates, but we're running into some challenges with screen reader behavior, particularly in Safari. Some of the dynamic content updates aren't being announced consistently.\n\n[Sarah Chen] What's our current WCAG compliance percentage?\n\n[Liam Foster] We're at 87% right now, and with these new color palettes and Emily's ARIA implementations, we should be able to reach our 95% target. I've also been working on improving keyboard navigation patterns across the dashboard.\n\n[Alex Rodriguez] Speaking of keyboard navigation, we might need to adjust our focus management approach with the new Safari WebAuthn fallback. I'm thinking we should implement a focus trap manager specifically for the authentication flow.\n\n[Emily Watson] Yes, and we'll need to ensure it works seamlessly with both the standard flow and the Safari-specific fallback. I've started mapping out the focus order and it's getting a bit complex with the additional confirmation step.\n\n[Sarah Chen] Okay, let's make sure we have clear next steps. Emily and Alex, could you schedule a technical sync this afternoon to finalize the Safari fallback approach?\n\n[Alex Rodriguez] Definitely. I've already set up a testing environment with different Safari versions. Emily, would 2 PM work for you?\n\n[Emily Watson] Yes, that works. I'll bring my documentation on the screen reader behavior patterns we've observed.\n\n[Michael Kim] Before we wrap up, I should mention that I've updated the database monitoring dashboard to track partition distribution metrics. Olivia, could you set up additional alerts for any significant distribution anomalies?\n\n[Olivia Martinez] Already on it. I'm setting up a dedicated Grafana dashboard for partition metrics, and I'll add alerts for any distribution skews above 15%.\n\n[Sarah Chen] Great. Just to confirm our immediate actions: Emily and Alex will sync on Safari WebAuthn this afternoon, Michael will complete the partitioning documentation by tomorrow, and Liam will circulate the new color palettes for review. Anything blocking anyone that we haven't addressed?\n\n[Emily Watson] Just one thing - we might need some input from the security team on the token lifetime adjustments for Safari. Alex, should we include them in our sync?\n\n[Alex Rodriguez] Good call. I'll reach out to them right after this meeting.\n\n[Sarah Chen] Perfect. Let's wrap up here and move forward with these action items. Michael, let's schedule a quick one-on-one to review the documentation before you head to the conference.\n\n[Michael Kim] Sounds good. I'm available after lunch.\n\n[Sarah Chen] Excellent. Thanks everyone for your updates. Let's keep the momentum going on these improvements.\n\nFINISHED"
