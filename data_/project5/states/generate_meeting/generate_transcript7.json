    "transcript": "[Sarah Chen] Good morning everyone! It's 10 AM, let's get started with our Daily Scrum. I know we have several critical updates to cover today, especially with Michael heading to the database conference later this week. Let's keep it focused and move any detailed technical discussions to our sync later today. Michael, why don't you start with the database partitioning update?\n\n[Michael Kim] Thanks, Sarah. Yes, I've been working on implementing the hybrid partitioning strategy. The time-series partitioning for daily health metrics is showing promising results in our test environment. I've managed to reduce query response times by approximately 40% for large datasets. However, I've identified a potential bottleneck with the hash partitioning for user profiles when we scale beyond 100,000 users. I'll need to sync with Alex about this later.\n\n[Sarah Chen] That sounds significant. Is this going to impact the health metrics dashboard development?\n\n[Michael Kim] It shouldn't block immediate progress, but we'll need to address it before going to production. I've documented my findings and will share them before I head to the conference. Emily and Liam can proceed with the frontend work as planned.\n\n[Sarah Chen] Good to know. Emily, can you update us on the accessibility improvements?\n\n[Emily Watson] Sure. We're currently at 87% WCAG compliance, and I've been focusing on the keyboard navigation improvements since yesterday. The main challenge we're facing is with the macro-nutrient charts. I've identified several color contrast issues that don't meet AA standards. Liam and I have been working on alternatives that maintain visual appeal while meeting compliance requirements.\n\n[Liam Foster] If I can jump in here \u2013 I've created three new color palette options that meet the contrast requirements. I'll share them with the team today. The tricky part is ensuring they work well with our existing component library. Emily and I are planning to update several core components to better handle these accessibility requirements.\n\n[Emily Watson] Exactly. We've also discovered that some of our dynamic content updates aren't being properly announced by screen readers. I'm implementing proper ARIA live regions to fix this.\n\n[Sarah Chen] Thanks both. Alex, what's your status on the nutrition logging feature?\n\n[Alex Rodriguez] Right, so I've made good progress with the two-tier caching strategy. The local cache is working well for offline support, but I'm running into some edge cases with data synchronization when users have poor connectivity. I've implemented a queue system for failed API calls, but we need to decide on the retry strategy. Also, the NutriAPI Pro integration is mostly complete, but I need to coordinate with Michael on some database optimization questions before he leaves for the conference.\n\n[Sarah Chen] Noted. Olivia, how are we doing with the test suite updates?\n\n[Olivia Martinez] I've expanded our cross-browser testing configuration to capture the Safari-specific issues we discussed last week. The automated accessibility tests are now integrated into our CI pipeline, but they're currently failing due to the color contrast issues Emily mentioned. I've also set up detailed logging for the new database partitioning tests, which should help us identify any performance regression issues early.\n\n[Sarah Chen] Are we still seeing those biometric authentication issues in Safari?\n\n[Olivia Martinez] Yes, but I've isolated the problem. It appears to be related to how Safari handles the WebAuthn API differently. I've documented the specific scenarios and will need to sync with Emily and Alex to discuss potential solutions.\n\n[Emily Watson] I can help with that. I've dealt with similar WebAuthn issues in previous projects. Maybe we can discuss this during the technical sync later?\n\n[Sarah Chen] That would be perfect. Any blockers or issues anyone needs help with?\n\n[Michael Kim] I'll need about an hour with Alex today to go through the service layer architecture before I start implementing the database changes. Could we schedule that?\n\n[Alex Rodriguez] I'm free after lunch. I'll send you a calendar invite right after this meeting.\n\n[Liam Foster] I need Emily's input on the new component designs, especially regarding the keyboard navigation patterns. Could we schedule a quick review?\n\n[Emily Watson] Of course. I have a gap between 11 and 12 today if that works for you?\n\n[Sarah Chen] Okay, I'm hearing several things that need follow-up discussions. Let's make sure to capture these in our technical sync later. Just to summarize: Michael and Alex will meet about service layer architecture, Emily and Liam will review component designs, and we'll discuss the Safari issues during the technical sync. Michael, make sure to document everything critical before you head to the conference, and let's schedule a remote sync for Thursday if needed.\n\n[Michael Kim] Will do. I'll have the documentation ready by end of day tomorrow.\n\n[Sarah Chen] Perfect. Anyone have any final quick updates or blockers to share?\n\n[Olivia Martinez] Just a heads up \u2013 I'll be pushing updates to the test suite this afternoon. There might be some temporary pipeline failures while I adjust the thresholds for the accessibility tests.\n\n[Sarah Chen] Thanks for the warning, Olivia. Please post in the development channel when you start. Alright, let's wrap this up here and move any technical discussions to our sync later. Great updates everyone!\n\nFINISHED"
