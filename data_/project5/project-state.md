# HealthTrack Pro Project State

## Sprint 1 (Closed)
[Content remains unchanged]

## Sprint 2 (Current)
Start Date: 2024-07-04
End Date: 2024-07-17
Demo Date: 2024-07-18

### Sprint Goals
[Content remains unchanged]

### Key Decisions
- Implement intermediate confirmation step specifically for Safari users in WebAuthn flow
- Extend token expiration grace period to 30 seconds for Safari users
- Implement a queue system with Redis-based queue and exponential backoff for failed authentication attempts
- Add visual indicators and ARIA announcements for the authentication process
- Implement a hybrid partitioning strategy with modified hash function to address distribution issues
- Postpone major schema changes until Michael's return from the conference

### User Stories and Tasks

1. Health Metrics Dashboard Implementation (34 story points)
   - Implement database partitioning changes (13 points, Michael Kim)
     - Status: In Progress
     - Update: Documentation 80% complete, 40% reduction in query response times achieved
     - Challenge: Potential bottleneck identified for user profiles beyond 100,000 users
     - Next steps: Review modified hash function with Alex, set up Grafana dashboards for monitoring partition metrics
   - Develop frontend components for real-time updates (Emily Watson, Liam Foster)
     - Status: In Progress
     - Update: Implemented visual indicators for authentication process and ARIA announcements for screen readers
     - Challenge: Inconsistent behavior across different screen readers, especially in Safari
   - Implement service layer improvements for nutrition API (8 points, Alex Rodriguez)
     - Status: In Progress
     - Update: Implemented Redis-based queue with exponential backoff for failed authentication attempts

2. Nutrition Logging Feature Completion
   - Implement offline support and data synchronization (Emily Watson, Michael Kim)
     - Status: In Progress
     - Update: Local cache working well for offline support, but unexpected growth patterns observed
     - Next steps: Implement cleanup strategy, may need threshold adjustments
   - Develop clear indicators for data freshness in UI (Liam Foster)
     - Status: In Progress
     - Update: Added visual cues to show last data sync time
     - Next steps: Share new designs with the team after the meeting

3. Accessibility Improvements (13 points total)
   - Increase WCAG compliance from 87% to 95% (All team members)
     - Current Status: 87% compliance achieved, working towards 95% target
   - Address color contrast issues in macro-nutrient charts (5 points, Liam Foster)
     - Update: Created three new color palette options meeting WCAG 2.1 AA requirements
   - Implement ARIA live regions for dynamic content (Emily Watson)
     - Status: In Progress
     - Challenge: VoiceOver on Safari handles dynamic content updates differently
     - Update: Implemented workaround using aria-atomic attributes, but not ideal
   - Improve focus management during authentication flow (Emily Watson)
     - Status: In Progress
     - Challenge: Identified focus management issues during the authentication flow

4. Cross-Browser Compatibility
   - Address Safari-specific issues with biometric authentication (Emily Watson, Alex Rodriguez)
     - Status: In Progress
     - Update: Developed Safari-specific detection method
     - Next steps: Implement intermediate confirmation step for Safari users
   - Implement browser-specific fallbacks (Alex Rodriguez)
     - Status: In Progress
     - Update: Proposed extending token expiration grace period to 30 seconds for Safari users
     - Next steps: Discuss token lifetime adjustments with security team, provide update by next standup
   - Enhance automated tests for browser-specific issues (Olivia Martinez)
     - Status: In Progress
     - Update: Expanded testing configuration to consistently capture Safari-specific issues
     - Next steps: Set up dedicated Slack channel for cross-browser testing reports

5. Database Performance Optimization
   - Implement hybrid partitioning strategy (Michael Kim)
     - Status: In Progress
     - Update: Modified hash function to address distribution issues
   - Set up detailed monitoring for new partitioning strategy (Michael Kim, Olivia Martinez)
     - Status: In Progress
     - Update: Plans to set up Grafana dashboards for monitoring partition metrics
     - Next steps: Implement alerts for partition distribution skews above 15%

### Infrastructure and Testing

1. Security Enhancements
   - Implement browser-specific token lifetime configuration (Alex Rodriguez)
     - Status: In Progress
     - Next steps: Discuss token lifetime adjustments for Safari with security team, provide update by next standup

2. Automated Testing Improvements
   - Update test suite with new accessibility and cross-browser testing requirements (Olivia Martinez)
     - Status: In Progress
     - Update: Integrated automated accessibility tests into CI pipeline
   - Implement automated notifications from testing pipeline to Slack (Olivia Martinez)
     - Status: In Progress
     - Next steps: Set up dedicated Slack channel for cross-browser testing reports

### Action Items
1. Alex and Emily: Finalize Safari fallback approach for WebAuthn implementation.
2. Michael: Complete database partitioning documentation and review modified hash function with Alex before the conference.
3. Liam: Share new UI designs for data freshness indicators with the team.
4. Alex: Consult with the security team about token lifetime adjustments for Safari and report back by next standup.
5. Olivia: Set up dedicated Slack channel for cross-browser testing reports and implement alerts for partition distribution skews.
6. Sarah: Conduct post-lunch sync with Michael for detailed review of database partitioning documentation.
7. All team members: Prepare for Michael's remote attendance and potential absence during the conference next week.

### Risks and Mitigation Strategies
1. Database performance (Owner: Michael Kim)
   - Update: Potential bottleneck identified with hash partitioning for user profiles, needs addressing
   - Mitigation: Modified hash function to address distribution issues, setting up Grafana dashboards for monitoring
2. Browser compatibility (Owner: Emily Watson, Alex Rodriguez)
   - Update: Ongoing problems with Safari related to WebAuthn API handling differences
   - Mitigation: Implementing Safari-specific detection method and intermediate confirmation step
3. Testing complexity (Owner: Olivia Martinez)
   - Update: Expanded configuration to capture Safari-specific issues consistently
   - Mitigation: Setting up dedicated Slack channel for cross-browser testing reports
4. Security compliance (Owner: Alex Rodriguez)
   - Update: Proposed extending token expiration grace period for Safari users
   - Mitigation: Discussing token lifetime adjustments with security team
5. Accessibility compliance (Owner: Liam Foster, Emily Watson)
   - Update: Current WCAG compliance at 87%, working towards 95% target
   - Mitigation: Created new color palettes for review, implementing workarounds for screen reader inconsistencies

### Capacity Notes
- Michael Kim attending database conference next week (available remotely for daily standups and critical discussions)
- Emily Watson has a dental appointment on Tuesday afternoon next week
- Sarah to account for Emily's absence in next week's planning

### Upcoming Meetings
1. Daily standup: Tomorrow at 10 AM
2. Post-lunch sync: Today (Sarah and Michael) for detailed review of database partitioning documentation
3. Remote sync with Michael: As needed during conference (to be scheduled by Sarah)

### Additional Notes
- Michael has prepared detailed documentation for likely scenarios during his conference absence
- Alex will handle most database concerns in Michael's absence
- Team to maintain momentum during Michael's partial absence next week
