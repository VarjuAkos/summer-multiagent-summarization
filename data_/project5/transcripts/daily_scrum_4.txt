[Sarah Chen] Good morning everyone! It's 10 AM, and let's get started with our daily scrum. Today we're focusing heavily on the technical design review aspects, particularly around authentication and accessibility. Emily and Liam, would you like to start with your authentication flow dry run results?

[Emily Watson] Thanks, Sarah. Yes, Liam and I spent yesterday afternoon going through the complete authentication flow, and we've identified several key points we need to discuss. The most pressing issue is the Safari compatibility with our biometric authentication implementation. We're seeing inconsistent behavior across different versions of Safari, particularly with the WebAuthn API.

[Liam Foster] If I could add to that - the UI components themselves are solid, but we're noticing that the biometric prompt's color contrast isn't meeting WCAG standards. I've prepared some alternative designs that maintain the visual hierarchy while improving accessibility.

[Emily Watson] Right, and specifically with Safari, we're seeing a complete failure to initialize the biometric prompt in versions older than 15.4. This affects approximately 12% of our potential user base according to our analytics.

[Alex Rodriguez] I've been looking into this issue, and I think I have a potential solution. We could implement a progressive enhancement approach where we detect Safari's WebAuthn support level before attempting to initialize the biometric prompt. I've prepared some code examples that I'd like to share.

[Sarah Chen] That sounds promising. Michael, did you have a chance to complete the 2FA error code documentation you were working on?

[Michael Kim] Yes, I finished it late yesterday. I've mapped out all possible error states and their corresponding codes. The main challenge we're facing is handling edge cases where the 2FA token expires during the authentication attempt. I'm proposing we implement a grace period of 30 seconds to handle these cases.

[Emily Watson] That would help with the UI implementation. Currently, users are getting abruptly kicked out if their token expires. I was thinking we could add a countdown timer in the UI when we're within 30 seconds of expiration.

[Liam Foster] I can show you the mockups I've created for that countdown timer. I've made sure it's accessible to screen readers and includes appropriate ARIA live regions for real-time updates.

[Olivia Martinez] Speaking of accessibility, I've been running automated tests across our components, and we're seeing several issues with ARIA labels in the authentication flow. Also, the security scanning rules for the NutriAPI integration are raising some concerns.

[Alex Rodriguez] What kind of concerns are you seeing with the API, Olivia?

[Olivia Martinez] The main issue is with response validation. We're getting inconsistent data formats in some edge cases, and our current scanning rules aren't catching all potential security vulnerabilities. I've identified three specific patterns we need to address.

[Sarah Chen] Could you elaborate on those patterns? This sounds like something we need to prioritize.

[Olivia Martinez] Absolutely. First, we're seeing unescaped HTML in some API responses, particularly in the food description fields. Second, there are instances where the API is returning sensitive user data in error messages. And third, we're noticing some potential SQL injection vectors in the query parameters.

[Alex Rodriguez] I can help with that. We should implement a sanitization layer before the data hits our frontend. I've worked with similar issues in previous projects. The key is to sanitize at the boundary, not just at the display level.

[Michael Kim] That aligns well with the backend changes I'm implementing. I can add validation middleware that checks for these patterns before the data even reaches our application logic.

[Emily Watson] While we're on the topic of security, can we discuss the fall-back authentication flow? When biometric auth fails, we're currently defaulting to password-based 2FA, but the user experience feels clunky.

[Liam Foster] I agree. I've observed users getting confused during testing. They often don't realize they've been switched to the fallback method. I've sketched out some UI improvements that make the transition more explicit.

[Sarah Chen] Could you share those sketches with the team, Liam?

[Liam Foster] Sure, I'm sharing my screen now. You can see here that I've added a clear visual indicator when we switch authentication methods. The new design includes an animated transition and explicit messaging about why the switch occurred.

[Emily Watson] That's much clearer. But I'm concerned about the animation performance on lower-end devices. We should probably add a `prefers-reduced-motion` media query check.

[Olivia Martinez] I can add that to our test matrix. Speaking of testing, I've set up the initial security scanning pipeline for the nutrition API responses. Alex, could you review the rules I've configured?

[Alex Rodriguez] Of course. I noticed you've included pattern matching for common injection attempts, but we might want to add some additional checks for JSON structure validation. I've seen cases where malformed JSON can lead to parsing vulnerabilities.

[Michael Kim] That reminds me - we need to standardize our error handling between the frontend and backend. The current error messages aren't consistent across different failure modes.

[Emily Watson] Yes, I've noticed that. Sometimes we get detailed error messages that are too technical for end users, and other times we get generic errors that don't provide enough information for users to take action.

[Sarah Chen] This seems like a critical issue to resolve before the design review later today. Michael, could you walk us through your error categorization system?

[Michael Kim] I've defined four main categories of errors: authentication failures, validation errors, network issues, and system errors. Each category has specific error codes and user-friendly message templates. Let me share my screen to show the documentation...

[To be continued...][Michael Kim] ...as you can see in this documentation, each error code has a corresponding user message and technical details. For example, error code AUTH_201 indicates a biometric verification timeout, while AUTH_202 represents an invalid 2FA token.

[Emily Watson] This is really helpful, Michael. I see you've included localization keys for each message. Should we implement these in this sprint, or should we create a separate task for internationalization?

[Sarah Chen] Let's stay focused on the core functionality for now. Olivia, you mentioned earlier about the automated accessibility testing. Could you share those results?

[Olivia Martinez] Yes, I ran a comprehensive scan last night. We're currently at 87% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. The main issues are in three areas: color contrast in the biometric prompt, missing ARIA labels in the activity input forms, and keyboard navigation in the 2FA flow.

[Liam Foster] I can address the color contrast issues immediately. I've already prepared an updated color palette that meets AA standards while maintaining our brand identity. The bigger challenge is the keyboard navigation flow.

[Emily Watson] I've been working on the keyboard navigation. The tricky part is handling the focus states when users switch between authentication methods. We need to ensure the focus doesn't get trapped in the biometric prompt if it fails.

[Alex Rodriguez] I have a suggestion for the keyboard navigation. We could implement a focus trap manager that automatically handles focus states based on the authentication context. I've written something similar for another project.

[Sarah Chen] That sounds promising. Alex, could you share that code with Emily after the meeting? Now, let's discuss the security scanning implementation. Olivia?

[Olivia Martinez] The initial security scanning rules are in place, but we're seeing some false positives with the nutrition API responses. I've configured Jenkins to flag any responses containing potential PII, but it's catching some legitimate food description data.

[Alex Rodriguez] We need to fine-tune those rules. I suggest we create a whitelist for common food-related terms that might trigger the PII detection. Also, we should implement rate limiting on the API calls to prevent potential DOS attacks.

[Michael Kim] Speaking of API calls, I've implemented the caching layer we discussed yesterday. It should reduce our API calls by approximately 60% during peak usage.

[Emily Watson] That's great, but how does it affect the real-time data updates? Some users might expect their nutrition data to update immediately.

[Michael Kim] I've implemented a staleness checker that forces a refresh if the data is more than 15 minutes old, or immediately if the user explicitly requests an update.

[Liam Foster] We should make that staleness state visible in the UI. I can add a subtle indicator to show when the data was last updated.

[Sarah Chen] Good point. Before we wrap up, let's quickly go around and identify any blockers. Emily?

[Emily Watson] My main blocker is the Safari biometric implementation. I need Alex's input on the WebAuthn approach before I can finalize the authentication flow.

[Alex Rodriguez] I'll have that documentation to you by noon today. No blockers on my end, but I need Olivia's final security scanning rules to complete the API integration.

[Michael Kim] No major blockers, but I'd like to pair with Alex on the encryption key rotation implementation this afternoon.

[Liam Foster] I need Emily's sign-off on the updated color scheme before I can update the design system documentation.

[Olivia Martinez] I'm blocked on implementing some of the security tests until Alex provides the API response validation patterns we discussed.

[Sarah Chen] Alright, let's make sure those handoffs happen today. One last thing - everyone please review your components for accessibility compliance before the design review at 2 PM. Emily and Liam, could you prepare a quick demo of the authentication flow?

[Emily Watson] Yes, we'll have that ready. I'll focus on the happy path and error states.

[Liam Foster] And I'll prepare screenshots of the accessibility improvements we've made.

[Sarah Chen] Perfect. Thanks everyone. Remember to update your tasks in Jira and let's make sure we're all set for the design review this afternoon. Anything else before we wrap up?

[Alex Rodriguez] Just a quick reminder - I'll be sending out the WebAuthn implementation guide within the next hour. Please review it before the design review.

[Sarah Chen] Excellent. Thanks everyone for your time. Let's have a productive day!
