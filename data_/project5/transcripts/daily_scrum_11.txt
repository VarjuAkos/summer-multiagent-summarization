[Sarah Chen] Good morning everyone! It's 10 AM, let's get started with our Daily Scrum. We have some critical items to discuss today, particularly with Michael heading to the conference next week. Let's start with Emily and Alex on the Safari WebAuthn implementation.

[Emily Watson] Thanks, Sarah. Alex and I had a technical sync yesterday about the Safari authentication issues. We've developed a solution that involves implementing an intermediate confirmation step specifically for Safari users. The main challenge we're facing is the inconsistent behavior of the WebAuthn API across different Safari versions.

[Alex Rodriguez] Right, and I want to add that we've found a way to detect Safari specifically and implement the intermediate step without compromising security. The key change we're proposing is to extend the token expiration grace period to 30 seconds specifically for Safari users. I've drafted the implementation approach, but I'd like to get everyone's thoughts on the security implications.

[Michael Kim] From a security standpoint, the extended grace period shouldn't pose significant risks if we implement proper rate limiting. Have you considered implementing a queue system for failed authentication attempts?

[Alex Rodriguez] Yes, we've actually built that into the design. We're using a Redis-based queue that will handle retry attempts with exponential backoff. The main concern I have is how this might impact the user experience during poor connectivity scenarios.

[Emily Watson] That's actually something we've tested extensively. We've found that adding visual indicators during the authentication process helps users understand what's happening. I've also implemented ARIA announcements for screen readers to maintain accessibility during these states.

[Sarah Chen] Speaking of accessibility, where do we stand with the WCAG compliance improvements?

[Liam Foster] Currently at 87%. I've created three new color palette options for the macro-nutrient charts that meet WCAG 2.1 AA requirements. Emily and I have been working on the ARIA live regions, but we're seeing some inconsistent behavior across different screen readers, particularly in Safari.

[Emily Watson] Yes, the main issue is that VoiceOver on Safari handles dynamic content updates differently than NVDA or JAWS. We've implemented a workaround using aria-atomic attributes, but it's not ideal. We're also seeing some focus management issues during the authentication flow.

[Sarah Chen] Michael, can you update us on the database partitioning documentation before we lose you to the conference next week?

[Michael Kim] The documentation is about 80% complete. The hybrid partitioning strategy is showing really promising results - we've achieved a 40% reduction in query response times. However, I've identified a potential bottleneck with the hash partitioning for user profiles when we scale beyond 100,000 users.

[Olivia Martinez] I've been monitoring the partition distribution patterns, and I'm seeing some uneven distribution in certain ranges. Should we adjust the hash function before Michael leaves for the conference?

[Michael Kim] Yes, I've actually modified the hash function to better handle the distribution. I'll need to walk through the changes with Alex and document the implementation details before I head out. I've also set up detailed monitoring with Grafana dashboards to track partition metrics.

[Sarah Chen] Let's talk about coordination during your conference absence, Michael. How should the team handle any critical database issues that might come up?

[Michael Kim] I'll be available remotely for our daily standups, and I've prepared detailed documentation for the most likely scenarios. Alex knows the partitioning strategy well enough to handle most issues, but I'll keep my phone on for any critical situations.

[Alex Rodriguez] I can handle the immediate database concerns, but we should probably hold off on any major schema changes until Michael returns. I'll focus on the Safari authentication implementation in the meantime.

[Sarah Chen] Good point. Emily, how's the two-tier caching implementation coming along?

[Emily Watson] The local cache is working well for offline support, but we're seeing some unexpected growth patterns that need attention. Alex and I have implemented the cleanup strategy, but we might need to adjust the thresholds.

[Liam Foster] The UI indicators for cached data are ready - I've added subtle visual cues to show when data was last synced. Should I share the new designs with everyone after the meeting?

[Sarah Chen] Yes, please do. One last thing before we wrap up - Olivia, any updates on the testing infrastructure?

[Olivia Martinez] I've expanded our testing configuration to consistently capture Safari-specific issues, and I'm setting up a dedicated Slack channel for cross-browser testing reports. The automated accessibility tests are now integrated into our CI pipeline, and I'm working on implementing alerts for partition distribution skews above 15%.

[Sarah Chen] Excellent. For next week, remember that Emily has a dental appointment on Tuesday afternoon, and Michael will be remote. Let's make sure all critical tasks are properly coordinated. Anything else we need to discuss?

[Alex Rodriguez] Just one quick thing - I'll be reaching out to the security team today about those token lifetime adjustments for Safari. Should have an answer by tomorrow's standup.

[Sarah Chen] Perfect. Thanks everyone - let's keep the momentum going. Michael, we'll sync up after lunch for a detailed review of the documentation.
