[Sarah Chen] Good morning everyone! Let's start our daily scrum. As you know, we have several critical items due today, including the API research and SSH key submissions. Let's go around and get updates from everyone. Emily, would you like to start with the frontend authentication progress?

[Emily Watson] Sure, Sarah. I've completed about 60% of the frontend authentication components. Yesterday, I finished implementing the basic login form with validation and error handling. Currently working on the two-factor authentication UI components. I'm facing a small challenge with the biometric authentication integration – we need to clarify some browser compatibility issues. I'll need to sync with Michael about the API endpoints for the 2FA verification.

[Michael Kim] I can help with that, Emily. Regarding the backend authentication, I've implemented the secure password hashing and rate limiting for login attempts. The JWT token management is mostly done, but I'm still working on the session handling implementation. Also, about the database schema documentation that's due today – I'm finalizing it now. I've completed the partitioning strategy for activity data, and I've added detailed comments about the flexible structure for different activity types.

[Sarah Chen] Thanks, Michael. How's the field-level encryption coming along? Alex, I know you were supposed to review that.

[Alex Rodriguez] Yes, I've reviewed Michael's encryption approach, and it looks solid. But I actually want to discuss a potential security concern I found during the review. Michael, I noticed we might need to adjust the salt generation method for the password hashing. Also, regarding the nutrition API research that's due today – I've completed the comparison of three potential providers. I have a strong recommendation for using NutriAPI Pro because of their robust offline caching support and competitive pricing. I can share the detailed analysis after the stand-up.

[Olivia Martinez] Speaking of security, I need to remind everyone about the SSH key submissions due today for the CI/CD pipeline setup. So far, I've only received keys from Emily and Michael. Alex and Liam, could you please send those over by noon? Also, I've started setting up the initial pipeline configuration with the security scanning integration.

[Liam Foster] Sorry about the SSH key delay, Olivia. I'll send it right after this meeting. From the design side, I've been working closely with Emily on the authentication flow UI. We've made some adjustments to improve the accessibility of the 2FA screens, particularly for screen readers. I'm a bit concerned about the color contrast on the biometric authentication prompt – we might need to adjust that.

[Emily Watson] Liam, I noticed that too. Maybe we could schedule a quick sync after this to review the contrast ratios? Also, I have a question about the form validation feedback – should we use toast notifications or inline errors?

[Michael Kim] Before we discuss that, I should mention a potential blocker. The database partitioning strategy might impact how we store the user activity logs. Alex, since you're working on the nutrition API integration, we should probably sync on this because it could affect how we cache the nutrition data.

[Alex Rodriguez] Good catch, Michael. Yes, let's discuss that. I've actually been thinking about the caching strategy, especially for offline support. We might need to adjust our initial approach based on the partitioning scheme.

[Sarah Chen] These are all great points. Let me make sure I'm capturing the key blockers: Emily needs API endpoint clarification for 2FA, we have the database partitioning impact on activity logs, and there's a potential security concern with the password hashing. Is that correct?

[Olivia Martinez] There's one more potential blocker from my side. The security scanning integration in the CI/CD pipeline might require some additional configuration for scanning the nutrition API responses. Alex, could you help me set up the correct rules for that?

[Alex Rodriguez] Of course, Olivia. I can share the security requirements I've identified from the API analysis. We should probably set up data sanitization rules specifically for the nutrition data endpoints.

[Michael Kim] That reminds me – I need to mention that the database schema documentation will include specific validation rules for the nutrition data. I'll have that ready for review by early afternoon.

[Sarah Chen] Excellent. Just a quick reminder about today's technical sync at 10 AM where we can dive deeper into these issues. Also, don't forget about Thursday's design review. Emily and Liam, could you prepare a quick demo of the authentication flow for that?

[Liam Foster] Yes, I'll update the Figma prototypes today and sync with Emily on the implementation status.

[Emily Watson] Perfect. I should have all the main authentication components ready for demo by Thursday. I'll focus on the 2FA flows today after aligning with Michael on the endpoints.

[Sarah Chen] Great. Before we wrap up, any final blockers or concerns anyone needs to raise?

[Michael Kim] Just one quick thing – I might need some input from Alex on the encryption key rotation strategy. Could we discuss that during the technical sync?

[Alex Rodriguez] Definitely. I've actually prepared some documentation on that based on my previous experience. I'll share it before the sync meeting.

[Sarah Chen] Perfect. If there's nothing else, let's wrap up here. Remember: SSH keys to Olivia by noon, technical sync at 10 AM, and Alex, we'll need that API comparison documentation today. Thanks everyone!
