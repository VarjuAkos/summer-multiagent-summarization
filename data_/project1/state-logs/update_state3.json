Set up initial project structure (Frontend and Backend)\n2. Configure development environments (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)\n3. Set up CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins\n4. Configure Docker environments\n5. Create initial database schema\n6. Design user authentication flow and UI components\n7. Implement user registration form (Frontend)\n8. Create API endpoint for user registration (Backend)\n9. Implement secure password storage (Backend)\n10. Add email verification functionality\n\n## Risks and Blockers\n- Potential learning curve for team members with new technologies\n- Ensuring compliance with health data security standards (e.g., HIPAA)\n\n## Team Velocity and Capacity\n- Initial Team Velocity: 40 story points per sprint\n- Capacity Utilization: To be determined after first sprint\n\n## Sprint Scope Changes\nNo changes to sprint scope at this time.\n\n## Action Items\n1. Alex Rodriguez: Set up initial project structure, create repositories, configure ESLint and Prettier\n2. Emily Watson: Assist with frontend setup, configure TypeScript and Tailwind CSS\n3. Michael Kim: Set up backend structure and initial database schema\n4. Olivia Martinez: Set up CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins, configure Docker environments, draft testing strategy, research security standards and compliance requirements\n5. Liam Foster: Create shared Figma project, start building component library and design guidelines, share preliminary user personas\n6. Sarah Chen: Set up Confluence space and send calendar invites for recurring meetings\n\n## Notes\n- Daily stand-ups scheduled for 9:30 AM\n- Team will use Slack for communication and Jira for sprint and backlog tracking\n- Confluence will be used for project documentation\n- MVP features prioritized: User Authentication, Profile Management, Activity Tracking, Basic Health Metrics Dashboard, and Simplified Nutrition Logging\n- Goal Setting, Recommendation Engine, and Social Features postponed for future development\n```\n\nThis updated sprint state reflects the outcomes of the initial sprint planning meeting. It includes the sprint goal, duration, initial progress, and backlog items based on the prioritized MVP features. The burndown chart has been initialized with the starting story points. Risks, action items, and team updates have been added based on the meeting analysis. The sprint scope aligns with the project's initial focus on establishing core functionalities and project infrastructure.",
