### Sprint Backlog

Here goes the sprint backlog : 

User Story | Story Points | Status | Assigned To | Notes
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
As a user, I want to manually log my daily activities to track my health progress | 11 | In Progress | Emily, Michael | Frontend and backend implementation
As a user, I want to view a dashboard of my basic health metrics to understand my overall health status | 13 | In Progress | Emily, Michael, Liam | Dashboard design and implementation
As a user, I want to log my daily food intake to track my nutrition | 10 | Not Started | Emily, Michael | Basic implementation planned
Implement testing and quality assurance measures | 4 | In Progress | Olivia | Ongoing throughout sprint
Buffer for unforeseen challenges | 2 | Not Started | All | To be used as needed

### Impediments
Here goes the impediments : 

Impediment | Impact | Mitigation Plan | Status
--- | --- | --- | ---
Alex's reduced capacity due to ongoing security audit | Potential delay in security-related tasks | Redistribute some tasks to other team members; prioritize critical security work | Ongoing

### Key Decisions
- Prioritized activity tracking and health metrics dashboard over detailed nutrition logging
- Decided to use a simplified food database for initial nutrition logging feature
- Agreed to take on 40 story points for this sprint
- Distributed tasks across team members to balance workload and account for Alex's reduced capacity

### Risks
Here goes the risks : 

Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Plan
--- | --- | --- | ---
Data accuracy in manual logging | Medium | High | Implement data validation on both frontend and backend
Performance issues with data aggregation | Medium | High | Optimize database queries, consider caching strategies
User experience for data input | Low | Medium | Conduct usability testing, iterate on UI based on feedback
Delayed completion of security-related tasks | Medium | High | Prioritize critical security work, monitor progress closely

### Sprint Ceremonies
- Daily Scrum: 9:30 AM daily, online meeting
- Sprint Review: 2024-07-07, 2:00 PM
- Sprint Retrospective: 2024-07-07, 3:30 PM

### Notes
The team is entering this sprint with high morale and a clear focus on implementing core MVP features. The reduced capacity of Alex due to the ongoing security audit is a point of concern, but tasks have been redistributed to ensure critical work continues. The team will need to closely monitor progress on the nutrition logging feature, as it has been given lower priority but is still included in the sprint backlog.

The Gantt chart provides a detailed visual representation of the sprint schedule, showing task dependencies and parallel work streams. This will help the team track progress and identify potential bottlenecks during daily stand-ups. The team should pay special attention to the completion of foundational tasks, such as API development and UI design, as delays in these areas could impact subsequent tasks.

Regular check-ins on the progress of the security audit and its impact on Alex's availability for other tasks will be crucial. The team should be prepared to adjust the sprint plan if necessary, potentially leveraging the buffer for unforeseen challenges.
