## Notes and Recommendations
1. Prioritize the completion of the Confluence setup to ensure proper documentation from the project's inception.
2. Consider creating a checklist for the development environment setup to track progress and identify any potential bottlenecks.
3. As you prepare for daily stand-ups, create a template or structure to ensure efficient and effective communication during these meetings.
4. Keep in mind the need for research on security standards and compliance requirements (e.g., HIPAA) for health data. This may need to be addressed in the upcoming technical planning session.

Sarah, your leadership as a Scrum Master keeps our team agile and focused! Remember, just like a well-planned sprint, each day is an opportunity to make progress and overcome obstacles. Your ability to facilitate communication and manage risks is the compass that guides our project to success. Keep up the amazing work!
