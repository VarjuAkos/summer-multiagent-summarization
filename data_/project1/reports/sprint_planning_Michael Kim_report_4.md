## Your Contribution to Sprint Goals
Your tasks are crucial for the success of this sprint. By implementing the backend APIs and data aggregation service, you're providing the foundation for the activity tracking and health metrics dashboard features. Your work on the nutrition API endpoint will also support the basic food intake logging feature. Your expertise in database optimization will ensure the system performs well as we add these new features.

## Collaboration Points
- Emily: Coordinate on API design for frontend integration
- Olivia: Work together on performance testing of APIs
- Alex: Consult on security best practices for API implementation
- Liam: Discuss data requirements for dashboard visualization

## Notes and Additional Information
- Remember to implement data validation on the backend to ensure data accuracy
- Consider caching strategies when implementing the data aggregation service to improve performance
- Keep documentation up-to-date for all new APIs created
