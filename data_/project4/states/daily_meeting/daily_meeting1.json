Establish development environment\n2. Implement basic authentication system\n3. Create initial user profile features\n4. Begin activity tracking components\n\n### Success Criteria\n- Fully functional development environment with CI/CD pipeline\n- User registration and login system operational\n- Basic user profile creation and editing capability\n- Initial activity logging functionality (manual entry)\n\n### Tasks and Stories\n\n#### Development Environment Setup\n- [ ] Set up Jenkins pipeline configuration (Olivia Martinez, Due: End of day)\n  - Basic pipeline structure completed\n  - Blocked by AWS credential issues with IAM roles\n- [ ] Configure Docker containers for frontend, backend, and database (Olivia Martinez, In Progress)\n  - Frontend and backend containers running locally\n  - Fine-tuning PostgreSQL container for proper data persistence\n- [ ] Implement Git workflow with feature branches and pull requests (Team)\n- [ ] Set up database migration system (Michael Kim)\n\n#### Authentication System\n- [ ] Implement backend JWT authentication (Alex Rodriguez, In Progress)\n  - Basic structure set up on backend\n  - Using jsonwebtoken library with RS256 algorithm\n  - Working on token refresh mechanism\n- [ ] Create frontend auth components (Emily Watson, In Progress)\n  - Functional but unstyled login, register, and password reset forms created\n  - Styling to be discussed with Liam Foster\n- [ ] Design and implement user profile database schema (Michael Kim, In Progress)\n  - Initial user profile schema drafted\n  - Technical session scheduled for 11 AM today\n\n#### Activity Tracking\n- [ ] Develop backend API endpoints for activity tracking (Alex Rodriguez, 8 story points)\n- [ ] Implement security measures for data validation (Michael Kim, 2 story points)\n- [ ] Create frontend components for activity input and display (Emily Watson, 8 story points)\n- [ ] Design and implement dashboard widgets (Emily Watson, 5 story points)\n\n#### Testing\n- [ ] Set up core test cases for authentication and activity tracking (Olivia Martinez, In Progress)\n  - Setting up Cypress for end-to-end testing\n  - Started writing test cases for authentication flow\n- [ ] Implement end-to-end testing with Cypress (Olivia Martinez, Blocked)\n  - Progress blocked by incomplete development environment configuration\n\n### Blockers/Issues\n1. AWS credential issues delaying completion of development environment setup\n2. Delay in environment setup blocking progress on testing framework implementation\n3. Uncertainty around form validation approach may delay frontend development\n4. Implementation of micro-interactions may extend beyond MVP scope, requiring prioritization\n\n### Decisions Made\n1. Two-week sprint duration agreed upon\n2. Custom JWT implementation chosen for authentication\n3. Basic food database to be created for MVP, postponing external API integration\n4. Optimistic updates to be implemented on frontend for responsiveness\n\n### Action Items\n- Olivia Martinez: Resolve AWS credential issues and complete Jenkins pipeline setup (Due: End of day)\n- Alex Rodriguez & Emily Watson: Discuss and decide on form validation approach, considering accessibility requirements (Due: Immediately after standup)\n- Alex Rodriguez & Michael Kim: Meet to align on JWT storage requirements (Due: 10:30 AM today)\n- Emily Watson & Liam Foster: Schedule and conduct component styling sync, focusing on MVP requirements (Due: Today)\n- Michael Kim: Lead database schema technical session, emphasizing MVP feature support (Due: 11 AM today)\n- Liam Foster: Share component library documentation (Due: Early afternoon)\n- All team members: Update respective Jira tickets with current status and any blockers (Due: End of day)\n- Sarah Chen: Assess sprint progress and timeline, considering the impact of environment setup delays (Due: End of day)\n\n### Notes\n- Team capacity reduced by 20-25% for the first sprint to account for setup time\n- Potential challenges identified: ensuring data model flexibility for future integrations and managing frontend animation performance\n- Future considerations: integration strategy for fitness devices, implementation of recommendation engine, timeline for social features\n- UI/UX wireframes for authentication flow completed, with considerations for mobile responsiveness and potential micro-interactions\n- Daily standup meetings at 10 AM\n\n</updated_project_state>",

Development Environment Setup:\n   Quote: \"Encountering AWS credential issues with IAM roles\"\n   Relevance: This is a critical blocker for Sprint 1 goals, affecting the entire team's progress.\n\n2. Authentication System Implementation:\n   Quote: \"Basic structure set up on backend\" and \"Using jsonwebtoken library with RS256 algorithm for enhanced security\"\n   Relevance: This aligns with the Sprint 1 goal of implementing a basic authentication system.\n\n3. Frontend Component Development:\n   Quote: \"Created functional but unstyled login, register, and password reset forms\"\n   Relevance: This contributes to the Sprint 1 goal of creating initial user profile features.\n\n4. Database Schema Design:\n   Quote: \"Drafted initial user profile schema, critical for MVP features including authentication and activity tracking\"\n   Relevance: This supports multiple Sprint 1 goals and sets the foundation for future sprints.\n\n5. UI/UX Design Progress:\n   Quote: \"Finalized authentication flow wireframes in Figma\"\n   Relevance: This supports the implementation of user authentication and profile features.\n\nImportant decisions and their impact:\n1. Decision to use JWT with RS256 algorithm for authentication\n   Impact: Enhances security but may require additional implementation time\n\n2. Pending decision on form validation approach\n   Impact: May affect frontend development progress and accessibility compliance\n\nUpdates to project backlog:\nNo explicit updates to the backlog were mentioned, but the following tasks have progressed:\n- US001 (User Authentication System): In Progress\n- T001 (Development Environment Setup): In Progress, facing challenges\n- T002 (Wireframe Finalization): Completed for authentication flow\n- T003 (Database Schema Design): In Progress, ready for review\n\nPrioritization of information:\n1. AWS credential issues (highest priority due to blocking nature)\n2. Authentication system progress (high priority, core MVP feature)\n3. Frontend component development (high priority, visible progress)\n4. Database schema design (high priority, foundational for other features)\n5. UI/UX design progress (medium priority, supports implementation)\n</analysis>\n\n<general_info_summary>\nThe Sprint 1 kickoff meeting revealed significant progress on core MVP features, particularly in authentication system implementation and frontend component development. However, the team is facing a critical blocker with AWS credential issues, potentially impacting the entire sprint timeline. The authentication system is progressing with JWT implementation using RS256 algorithm, enhancing security. Frontend components for login, registration, and password reset are functional but require styling and finalization of the validation approach. The database schema design is ready for review, setting the foundation for MVP features. UI/UX wireframes for the authentication flow are complete. Key action items include resolving the AWS credential issues (due end of day), finalizing form validation approach, and conducting a database schema review. The project manager will reassess the sprint timeline considering these developments. All team members are required to update their Jira tickets by end of day to reflect current progress and blockers.\n</general_info_summary>"
