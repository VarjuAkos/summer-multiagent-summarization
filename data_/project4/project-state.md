# HealthTrack Pro Project State

## Sprint 1 (Current)
Start Date: 2024-06-10
End Date: 2024-06-24
Duration: 2 weeks
Capacity: Reduced by 20-25% for initial setup

### Sprint Goals
1. Establish development environment
2. Implement basic authentication system
3. Create initial user profile features
4. Begin activity tracking components

### Success Criteria
- Fully functional development environment with CI/CD pipeline
- User registration and login system operational
- Basic user profile creation and editing capability
- Initial activity logging functionality (manual entry)

### Tasks and Stories

#### Development Environment Setup
- [ ] Set up Jenkins pipeline configuration (Olivia Martinez, Due: End of day)
  - Basic pipeline structure completed
  - Blocked by AWS credential issues with IAM roles
- [ ] Configure Docker containers for frontend, backend, and database (Olivia Martinez, In Progress)
  - Frontend and backend containers running locally
  - Fine-tuning PostgreSQL container for proper data persistence
- [ ] Implement Git workflow with feature branches and pull requests (Team)
- [ ] Set up database migration system (Michael Kim)

#### Authentication System
- [ ] Implement backend JWT authentication (Alex Rodriguez, In Progress)
  - Basic structure set up on backend
  - Using jsonwebtoken library with RS256 algorithm
  - Working on token refresh mechanism
- [ ] Create frontend auth components (Emily Watson, In Progress)
  - Functional but unstyled login, register, and password reset forms created
  - Styling to be discussed with Liam Foster
- [ ] Design and implement user profile database schema (Michael Kim, In Progress)
  - Initial user profile schema drafted
  - Technical session scheduled for 11 AM today

#### Activity Tracking
- [ ] Develop backend API endpoints for activity tracking (Alex Rodriguez, 8 story points)
- [ ] Implement security measures for data validation (Michael Kim, 2 story points)
- [ ] Create frontend components for activity input and display (Emily Watson, 8 story points)
- [ ] Design and implement dashboard widgets (Emily Watson, 5 story points)

#### Testing
- [ ] Set up core test cases for authentication and activity tracking (Olivia Martinez, In Progress)
  - Setting up Cypress for end-to-end testing
  - Started writing test cases for authentication flow
- [ ] Implement end-to-end testing with Cypress (Olivia Martinez, Blocked)
  - Progress blocked by incomplete development environment configuration

### Blockers/Issues
1. AWS credential issues delaying completion of development environment setup
2. Delay in environment setup blocking progress on testing framework implementation
3. Uncertainty around form validation approach may delay frontend development
4. Implementation of micro-interactions may extend beyond MVP scope, requiring prioritization

### Decisions Made
1. Two-week sprint duration agreed upon
2. Custom JWT implementation chosen for authentication
3. Basic food database to be created for MVP, postponing external API integration
4. Optimistic updates to be implemented on frontend for responsiveness

### Action Items
- Olivia Martinez: Resolve AWS credential issues and complete Jenkins pipeline setup (Due: End of day)
- Alex Rodriguez & Emily Watson: Discuss and decide on form validation approach, considering accessibility requirements (Due: Immediately after standup)
- Alex Rodriguez & Michael Kim: Meet to align on JWT storage requirements (Due: 10:30 AM today)
- Emily Watson & Liam Foster: Schedule and conduct component styling sync, focusing on MVP requirements (Due: Today)
- Michael Kim: Lead database schema technical session, emphasizing MVP feature support (Due: 11 AM today)
- Liam Foster: Share component library documentation (Due: Early afternoon)
- All team members: Update respective Jira tickets with current status and any blockers (Due: End of day)
- Sarah Chen: Assess sprint progress and timeline, considering the impact of environment setup delays (Due: End of day)

### Notes
- Team capacity reduced by 20-25% for the first sprint to account for setup time
- Potential challenges identified: ensuring data model flexibility for future integrations and managing frontend animation performance
- Future considerations: integration strategy for fitness devices, implementation of recommendation engine, timeline for social features
- UI/UX wireframes for authentication flow completed, with considerations for mobile responsiveness and potential micro-interactions
- Daily standup meetings at 10 AM
