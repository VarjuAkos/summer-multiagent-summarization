## Your Action Items and Next Steps
1. Implement backend JWT authentication system (5 story points, due by end of Week 1)
2. Develop backend API endpoints for activity tracking (8 story points)
3. Collaborate with Michael Kim on database schema design, particularly for user profiles and activity data
4. Participate in code reviews to maintain quality across the stack
5. Attend daily standups at 10 AM starting tomorrow
6. Join the additional technical session after tomorrow's standup to discuss database schema in detail

## General Team Information
- Development environment setup, including Jenkins pipeline and Docker containers, is a priority for the team
- Emily Watson will handle frontend components based on your backend implementations
- The team is starting with a basic food database for MVP nutrition logging, postponing external API integration
- Potential challenges identified: ensuring data model flexibility for future integrations and managing frontend animation performance

## Conclusion
As the Senior Full-Stack Developer, your role is crucial in establishing the backend foundation for HealthTrack Pro. Your focus on implementing secure authentication and robust activity tracking APIs will set the stage for the project's success. Remember to balance your development tasks with your mentoring responsibilities and keep future scalability in mind as you design the system architecture.
