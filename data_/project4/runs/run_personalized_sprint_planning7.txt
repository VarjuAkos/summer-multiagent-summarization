<general_info_summary>
The HealthTrack Pro project has officially kicked off with a sprint planning meeting. Key decisions include adopting two-week sprints with a 20-25% reduced capacity for the first sprint to account for setup time. The team prioritized MVP features: user authentication (using custom JWT), activity tracking, and basic nutrition logging with a simplified food database. Development environment setup, including CI/CD pipeline and Docker containers, is a critical first step. Sprint 1 will focus on establishing the development environment, implementing basic authentication, creating initial user profiles, and starting activity tracking components. The team identified potential challenges in ensuring data model flexibility for future integrations and managing frontend animation performance. These decisions align with the project's core requirements and set a foundation for the six-month MVP timeline. All team members should be aware of daily standups at 10 AM and an upcoming technical session to discuss the database schema in detail.

   - Goals
   - Success Criteria
3. Development Environment Setup
4. Authentication System
5. Activity Tracking
6. Nutrition Logging
7. Team Members
8. Action Items
9. Future Considerations

Relationships:
1. HealthTrack Pro Project connects to all main components (2-9)
2. Sprint 1 Details links to Development Environment Setup, Authentication System, and Activity Tracking
3. Team Members connect to their respective tasks in Development Environment Setup, Authentication System, and Activity Tracking
4. Action Items link to relevant team members and components
5. Future Considerations connect back to the main HealthTrack Pro Project node

Additional Notes:
- Use different colors for each main branch (e.g., Sprint 1 Details, Development Environment Setup, Authentication System, etc.) to visually separate concerns
- Use icons where applicable (e.g., a calendar icon for Sprint 1 Details, a gear icon for Development Environment Setup)
- For Team Members, use circular nodes with initials to represent each team member
- Use dotted lines to connect Action Items to their related components and team members
- Emphasize high-priority tasks with bold text or a distinctive color
- Include key dates (like sprint start and end dates) where relevant

The mindmap structure allows for a comprehensive overview of the project, highlighting the key areas of focus, team responsibilities, and the relationships between different aspects of the project. It provides a clear visual representation of the project's scope and priorities for the current sprint while also indicating future considerations.

Diagram Type: Gantt Chart

Key Components:
1. Sprint 1 timeline (2 weeks: 2024-06-10 to 2024-06-24)
2. Development Environment Setup tasks
3. Authentication System tasks
4. Activity Tracking tasks
5. Testing tasks
6. Team members (Alex Rodriguez, Emily Watson, Michael Kim, Olivia Martinez, Liam Foster)
7. Key milestones and deadlines

Relationships:
1. Tasks are assigned to specific team members
2. Tasks have start and end dates within the sprint
3. Some tasks have dependencies (e.g., frontend auth components depend on backend JWT implementation)
4. Milestones are linked to specific dates or task completions

Additional Notes:
- Use color coding to differentiate between different task categories (e.g., Development Environment, Authentication, Activity Tracking, Testing)
- Highlight high-priority tasks with a distinct color or marker
- Include a legend to explain color coding and symbols
- Use text annotations to indicate story points for each task
- Add a vertical line to represent the current date
- Include sprint goals and success criteria as a text section above or below the Gantt chart

The Gantt chart should be structured as follows:
- X-axis: Timeline covering the two-week sprint (2024-06-10 to 2024-06-24)
- Y-axis: Tasks grouped by category and assigned team member
- Each task bar should show the task name, assigned team member, and story points
- Milestones should be represented as diamond shapes at the end of relevant tasks
- Include a section for sprint goals and success criteria as text

This Gantt chart will provide a clear visual representation of the sprint timeline, task assignments, and overall project progress, making it easy for team members to understand their responsibilities and deadlines.
