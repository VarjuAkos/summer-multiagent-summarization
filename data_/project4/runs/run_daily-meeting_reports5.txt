--- PERSONAL DIAGRAM PLAN ---
<thinking>
Components:
1. Sprint 1 (Central node)
2. Sprint Goals (with 4 sub-goals)
3. Team Members (6 members)
4. Key Tasks (4 main tasks with sub-tasks)
5. Blockers/Risks
6. Action Items

Relationships:
- All main components branch out from the central Sprint 1 node
- Sub-items branch out from their respective main components
- Dotted lines between team members and primary responsibilities

Specific Requirements:
- Use different colors for main branches
- Use icons where applicable
- Highlight high-priority action items
- Include brief status notes on key tasks
- Use dotted lines for team member responsibilities

Structure:
- Central node: Sprint 1
- Five main branches: Sprint Goals, Team Members, Key Tasks, Blockers/Risks, Action Items
- Sub-branches for detailed information under each main branch

Challenges and Solutions:
1. Limited icon support in Mermaid mindmaps: We'll use text-based icons where possible.
2. Color limitations: We'll use different node shapes to distinguish branches.
3. Dotted lines not directly supported: We'll use parentheses to indicate connections.

Plan for Mermaid Syntax:
- Use mindmap syntax with appropriate indentation for hierarchy
- Utilize different node shapes for main branches (e.g., [), ((, ], >, {)
- Use * for sub-items
- Incorporate text-based icons and formatting for emphasis

   - Critical Tasks (6 tasks)
   - Blockers (4 items)
   - High Priority Action Items (6 items)
   - Project State (3 items)

2. Relationships:
   - Team Members are responsible for specific Critical Tasks
   - Blockers are impacting specific Critical Tasks
   - High Priority Action Items are assigned to specific Team Members
   - Sprint 1 Goals are related to specific Critical Tasks
   - Project State informs the overall context of Sprint 1 Goals and Team capacity

3. Specific Requirements:
   - Use color coding for different categories
   - Use icons to represent team roles
   - Use dotted lines for relationships between team members and tasks
   - Use red exclamation marks for blockers
   - Use green checkmarks for completed or in-progress items
   - Central node in the middle with radial branching
   - Clockwise arrangement of subcategories

Structure outline:
- Central node: HealthTrack Pro
- Main branches: Sprint 1 Goals, Team Members, Critical Tasks, Blockers, High Priority Action Items, Project State
- Sub-branches for each main category

Challenges and solutions:
1. Mermaid mindmap doesn't support custom icons or color coding. We'll use text-based representations instead (e.g., [!] for blockers, [✓] for completed items).
2. Relationships between different branches are not directly supported in mindmaps. We'll use textual references where possible.
3. Dotted lines and specific layouts are not controllable in Mermaid mindmaps. We'll focus on the hierarchical structure instead.

Incorporation plan:
1. Start with the root node (HealthTrack Pro)
2. Create main branches for each major category
3. Add sub-branches for all items within each category
4. Use text-based symbols to represent icons and status indicators
5. Include brief textual references to show relationships between items where possible
