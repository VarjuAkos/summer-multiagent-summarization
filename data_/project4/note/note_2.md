# HealthTrack Pro - Daily Scrum Meeting Note
Date: 2024-06-11 (Sprint 1, Day 2)
Time: 10:00 AM
Meeting Type: Daily Scrum

## I. Introduction and Sprint Context

Sarah Chen, the Scrum Master and Project Manager, started the meeting promptly at 10 AM, confirming it as the daily scrum for Sprint 1, Day 2 of the HealthTrack Pro project.

Sprint 1 Goals (June 10-24, 2024):
1. Establish development environment
2. Implement basic authentication system
3. Create initial user profile features
4. Begin activity tracking components

Note: Team capacity is reduced by 20-25% for this sprint due to initial setup requirements.

## II. Progress Overview

The team is making progress on core MVP features, focusing on development environment setup and authentication system implementation. However, some delays in environment configuration may impact the sprint timeline.

## III. Team Updates

### A. Olivia Martinez - QA Engineer / DevOps Specialist

1. Jenkins Pipeline Configuration:
   - Completed basic pipeline structure
   - Encountering AWS credential issues with IAM roles
   - Working with AWS support to resolve access problems for ECR registry

2. Docker Container Setup:
   - Frontend and backend containers running locally
   - Fine-tuning PostgreSQL container for proper data persistence

3. Estimated Resolution:
   - Aiming to resolve AWS credentials issue by end of day
   - Upon resolution, will complete pipeline setup
   - Docker compose files mostly ready, pending testing with updated credentials

4. Testing Framework:
   - Setting up Cypress for end-to-end testing
   - Started writing test cases for authentication flow
   - Planning Jest implementation for unit testing on both frontend and backend
   - Progress blocked by incomplete development environment configuration

### B. Alex Rodriguez - Senior Full-Stack Developer

1. JWT Implementation:
   - Basic structure set up on backend
   - Using jsonwebtoken library with RS256 algorithm for enhanced security

2. Token Refresh Mechanism:
   - Currently working on implementation
   - Considering offline periods for mobile devices to ensure smooth user experience

3. Planned Discussions:
   - Form validation approach with Emily post-meeting, including accessibility considerations
   - JWT storage requirements with Michael at 10:30 AM

### C. Emily Watson - Frontend Developer

1. Authentication Components:
   - Created functional but unstyled login, register, and password reset forms
   - Planning to sync with Liam for component styling later today

2. Concerns:
   - Raised question about form validation approach (client-side using Yup vs. basic HTML5)
   - Need to discuss feasibility of implementing micro-interactions within MVP timeline

### D. Michael Kim - Backend Developer

1. Database Schema:
   - Prepared for technical session post-standup
   - Drafted initial user profile schema, critical for MVP features including authentication and activity tracking
   - Mapped relationships between different entities

2. Concerns:
   - JWT refresh token storage structure in the database
   - Optimization of schema for upcoming activity tracking feature implementation

3. Preparations:
   - Created diagrams showing different approaches for activity tracking schema

### E. Liam Foster - UI/UX Designer

1. Wireframes:
   - Finalized authentication flow wireframes in Figma
   - Noted potential adjustments needed for mobile responsiveness, especially for registration form

2. Component Library:
   - Working on documentation, to be shared by early afternoon

3. Design Enhancements:
   - Included micro-interactions, particularly for form submission feedback
   - Plans to discuss implementation feasibility and prioritization with Emily

## IV. Risks and Blockers

1. AWS credential issues are delaying the completion of the development environment setup, potentially impacting the entire sprint timeline.
2. Delay in environment setup is blocking progress on testing framework implementation.
3. Uncertainty around form validation approach may delay frontend development.
4. Implementation of micro-interactions may extend beyond MVP scope, requiring prioritization.

## V. Action Items and Next Steps

High Priority:
1. Olivia: Resolve AWS credential issues and complete Jenkins pipeline setup (Due: End of day)
2. Alex & Emily: Discuss and decide on form validation approach, considering accessibility requirements (Due: Immediately after standup)
3. Alex & Michael: Meet to align on JWT storage requirements (Due: 10:30 AM today)
4. Emily & Liam: Schedule and conduct component styling sync, focusing on MVP requirements (Due: Today)
5. Michael: Lead database schema technical session, emphasizing MVP feature support (Due: 11 AM today)

Medium Priority:
6. Liam: Share component library documentation (Due: Early afternoon)
7. All team members: Update respective Jira tickets with current status and any blockers (Due: End of day)
8. Sarah: Assess sprint progress and timeline, considering the impact of environment setup delays (Due: End of day)

Ongoing:
9. Olivia: Continue setting up Cypress for end-to-end testing as environment allows
10. Alex: Finalize JWT implementation and token refresh mechanism
11. Emily: Implement agreed-upon form validation and begin styling components

## VI. Closing

Sarah reminded the team about the upcoming technical session at 11 AM and the importance of updating Jira tickets. She emphasized the need for collaboration, especially between Emily and Liam on component styling, and Alex and Emily on form validation. Sarah also noted that she would be reviewing the sprint timeline considering the current progress and blockers. The meeting was then adjourned.
