# HealthTrack Pro Project State

## Sprint 1 (June 10 - June 24, 2024)

### Sprint Goal
"Deliver a functional user authentication system with profile creation and a basic dashboard structure that sets the foundation for future feature development."

### Team Members and Responsibilities
- Sarah Chen (Scrum Master): Manage sprint board, facilitate meetings, track progress
- Alex Rodriguez (Senior Full-Stack Developer): Technical architecture, authentication system, form validation patterns
- Emily Watson (Frontend Developer): Component library, accessibility features, Tailwind CSS implementation
- Michael Kim (Backend Developer): Database schema, API structure, technical documentation
- Olivia Martinez (QA Engineer / DevOps Specialist): CI/CD pipeline, testing frameworks, DevOps setup
- Liam Foster (UI/UX Designer): Design system documentation, wireframe updates

### Sprint Backlog
1. User Registration (5 points)
   - Status: In Progress
   - Assignee: Alex Rodriguez
   - Tasks:
     - Implement password hashing (In Progress)
     - Set up email verification
     - Create frontend registration form
     - Implement form validation
   - Progress:
     - Created initial user schema and basic validation middleware
     - Considering JWT token rotation strategy (sliding window approach for refresh tokens)

2. Profile Setup (8 points)
   - Status: To Do
   - Assignee: Emily Watson
   - Tasks:
     - Create multiple form fields with validation rules
     - Implement image upload for profile pictures
     - Set up file storage and image processing on the backend

3. Basic Dashboard Layout (5 points)
   - Status: In Progress
   - Assignee: Liam Foster, Emily Watson
   - Tasks:
     - Design responsive layout (In Progress)
     - Implement initial component architecture (In Progress)
     - Set up Tailwind CSS configuration (In Progress)
   - Progress:
     - Liam: Completed about 60% of wireframe modifications
     - Emily: Setting up basic component architecture with accessibility focus
     - Implemented ARIA labels for form components needed for user registration

### Technical Decisions
- Backend: Modular monolith architecture
- Authentication: JWT tokens with refresh token rotation
- Frontend State Management: Redux Toolkit
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Database: PostgreSQL with JSONB columns

### DevOps Setup
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
  - Separate workflows created for dev, staging, and prod environments
- Environments: Development, Staging, Production
- Testing Frameworks: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress
  - Jest and Cypress configurations started
- Coverage Requirement: Minimum 80% for critical paths

### Action Items
1. Alex Rodriguez and Olivia Martinez:
   - Resolve AWS permissions issue for CI/CD pipeline (Due: ASAP)

2. Alex Rodriguez and Michael Kim:
   - Discuss JWT implementation and HIPAA-compliant token storage (Due: Today)

3. Emily Watson and Liam Foster:
   - Finalize Tailwind configuration and component spacing (Due: Today, 11 AM)

4. Liam Foster:
   - Complete updated wireframes without social login options (Due: EOD Today)

5. Sarah Chen:
   - Schedule HIPAA compliance discussion (Due: Tomorrow afternoon)

6. Alex Rodriguez:
   - Lead technical deep dive on authentication implementation (Due: Tomorrow, June 12)

7. All team members:
   - Continue development environment setup (Due: ASAP)

### Risks and Challenges
1. Tailwind CSS implementation may lead to inconsistent styling across components
   - Emily and Liam working on resolving configuration issues and ensuring design system consistency
2. Complexity of implementing proper JWT token rotation and security measures
   - Alex and Michael to discuss implementation details
3. Ensuring HIPAA compliance while maintaining system performance
   - Michael looking into HIPAA-compliant token storage approaches
   - Team concerned about ensuring data encryption methods meet HIPAA requirements
4. Potential scalability issues when transitioning from monolith to microservices in the future

### Follow-up Items
1. Decision on charting library (Chart.js vs D3.js) - to be reviewed in next technical meeting
2. Detailed plan for HIPAA compliance implementation - To be discussed in tomorrow's meeting
3. Review of potential third-party integrations for future sprints - Sarah to compile list by June 18

### Daily Standup
- Time: 10 AM Eastern, started June 11

### Next Steps
1. Address blockers:
   - Emily Watson: Resolve Tailwind configuration issues
   - Olivia Martinez: Solve AWS permissions problem in CI/CD pipeline
   - Alex Rodriguez and Michael Kim: Sync about JWT implementation and token rotation strategy
   - Michael Kim: Research HIPAA compliance for data encryption methods and token storage
2. Continue with development environment setup and initial implementation tasks
3. Prepare for technical deep dive on authentication implementation (June 12)

### Development Environment Status
- Alex Rodriguez: Environment mostly set up, Node.js and PostgreSQL configured
- Emily Watson: Frontend environment mostly configured, resolving Tailwind CSS setup issues
- Michael Kim: Environment about 80% ready, PostgreSQL running locally, finishing test database setup
- Olivia Martinez: Basic CI/CD pipeline structure set up, resolving AWS integration issues
- Liam Foster: Design tools set up and running
