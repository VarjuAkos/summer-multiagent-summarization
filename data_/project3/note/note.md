   - Rationale: Structured data with complex query needs, potential for analytics

2. Optimization Strategies
   - Implement proper indexing and partitioning
   - Action Item: Michael to add additional indices for frequently run queries by June 15

3. Data Validation
   - Implement server-side constraints for data integrity
   - Include check constraints, not-null constraints, and trigger functions for complex validations
