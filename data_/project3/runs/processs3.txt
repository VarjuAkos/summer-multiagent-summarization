Sarah outlined the agenda, emphasizing the importance of this initial sprint planning meeting for setting up the HealthTrack Pro MVP.

## II. Sprint Capacity Assessment

- Sprint Duration: 2 weeks
- Team Availability:
  - Emily Watson: Dentist appointment next Tuesday afternoon
  - Olivia Martinez: Virtual DevOps conference next Thursday
  - Other team members: Fully available
- Capacity: Approximately 9.5 person-days per team member, accounting for meetings and overhead

## III. MVP Feature Breakdown

### A. User Authentication

1. OAuth Integration
   - Decision: Use OAuth for MVP, with plans for custom authentication in future
   - Providers: Google and Apple
   - Estimated effort: 8 points (frontend + backend)

2. User Profile Management
   - Basic fields: name, email, health information (height, weight), activity preferences
   - Profile picture upload functionality
   - Estimated effort: 5 points (frontend), 3 points (backend)

3. Authentication Flow
   - Login page with OAuth options
   - JWT for session management
   - Basic error handling and security considerations

### B. Activity and Nutrition Tracking

1. Activity Tracking
   - Manual input interface
   - Fields: activity type, duration, intensity, notes
   - Calorie calculation based on user metrics
   - GPS data field added for future use
   - Estimated effort: 8 points (backend), 5 points (frontend)

2. Nutrition Tracking
   - Integration with USDA Food Database API
   - Searchable food database with autocomplete
   - Consideration for offline support and local caching
   - Estimated effort: 13 points (overall)
   - Note: Pushed to sprint two due to complexity

### C. Dashboard Requirements

1. Core Metrics
   - Daily activity summaries
   - Calorie intake vs. burn
   - Weekly progress view

2. Visualization
   - Decision: Use Chart.js for MVP (simpler than D3.js)
   - Real-time updates consideration (WebSocket implementation)

3. Data Management
   - Efficient data aggregation (PostgreSQL materialized views)
   - Caching strategy (Redis suggested by Olivia)

## IV. Technical Architecture Setup

### A. Frontend Architecture

1. Structure
   - Feature-based folder organization
   - React.js with TypeScript

2. State Management
   - Redux Toolkit for global state
   - RTK Query for API calls and caching

3. Testing
   - Jest for unit tests
   - React Testing Library for component testing

### B. Backend Architecture

1. Tech Stack
   - Node.js with Express.js
   - PostgreSQL for database

2. API Structure
   - Grouped by feature: /auth, /activities, /nutrition, /insights
   - Versioning: /api/v1/ prefix

3. Database
   - Separate instances for development, staging, and production
   - Flexible user schema to accommodate OAuth and custom fields

### C. DevOps and CI/CD

1. Infrastructure
   - Jenkins for CI/CD pipeline
   - Docker containers for development environments
   - AWS for hosting (specific services TBD)

2. Testing Strategy
   - Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests
   - Minimum test coverage: 80% for backend, 70% for frontend

3. Security
   - AWS Secrets Manager for production
   - dotenv for local development
   - IAM roles and policies set up

## V. Sprint Planning Details

### A. Story Breakdown and Estimation

1. Authentication Epic (21 points total)
   - OAuth integration (8 points)
   - User profile creation (5 points)
   - Session management (5 points)
   - Basic profile CRUD operations (3 points)

2. Frontend Stories (15 points total)
   - Login page implementation (5 points)
   - Profile page creation (5 points)
   - Navigation flow setup (5 points)

3. Activity Tracking (13 points total)
   - Backend API and database setup (8 points)
   - Frontend logging interface (5 points)

4. Testing and DevOps (13 points total)
   - Test infrastructure setup (5 points)
   - Initial test suite implementation (5 points)
   - CI/CD pipeline configuration (3 points)

### B. Definition of Done

- Code review completed
- Unit tests written and passing
- Integration tests passing
- Documentation updated
- Accessibility requirements met
- Proper error handling implemented
- Logging in place
- Performance metrics meeting baseline requirements
- Cross-browser testing completed (frontend)
- Responsive design verified (frontend)

### C. Risk Identification

1. OAuth integration complexity may exceed estimates
2. Real-time updates for dashboard could be more complex than anticipated
3. Calorie calculation logic may require iteration after initial testing
4. CI/CD pipeline setup might face challenges with AWS configuration

## VI. Action Items and Next Steps

1. Alex Rodriguez:
   - Set up project repositories and share access
   - Handle Google OAuth developer account setup
   - Coordinate overall technical architecture

2. Emily Watson:
   - Push initial React project structure and component library setup
