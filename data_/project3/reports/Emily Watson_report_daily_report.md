## Your Action Items and Next Steps
1. Resolve Tailwind CSS configuration issues, particularly with PostCSS and custom plugin compatibility.
2. Meet with Liam Foster at 11 AM today to finalize Tailwind configuration and component spacing.
3. Continue working on matching the Figma spacing scale with Tailwind's default spacing scale.
4. Proceed with the implementation of the basic component architecture, maintaining focus on accessibility.
5. Prepare for the upcoming technical deep dive on authentication implementation (June 12).
6. Review updated wireframes from Liam Foster (expected by EOD today) for frontend implementation.

## General Team Information
1. HIPAA compliance is a top priority. Be aware of potential impacts on frontend implementation, particularly regarding data handling and user interactions.
2. The team has decided to use JWT token rotation with a sliding window approach for refresh tokens. This may affect how you handle authentication states in the frontend.
3. Social login options have been removed from the initial design, which may impact your work on authentication flows.
4. A decision on the charting library (Chart.js vs D3.js) is pending and will be reviewed in the next technical meeting.
5. The DevOps team is setting up separate CI/CD workflows for development, staging, and production environments.

## Conclusion
Your focus on accessibility and component architecture is crucial for the project's progress. As we move forward, prioritize resolving the Tailwind CSS configuration issues and continue collaborating closely with the UI/UX team to ensure design system consistency. Stay informed about the HIPAA compliance requirements and prepare for the upcoming authentication implementation discussions. Your expertise in frontend development will be key in delivering a responsive and intuitive user interface for HealthTrack Pro.
