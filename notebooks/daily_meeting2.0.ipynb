    "<project_backlog>\n",
    "{PROJECT_BACKLOG}\n",

    "{MEETING_NOTE}\n",
    "</meeting_note>\n",
    "4. Analyze the meeting note and identify any potential new backlog items that are not already present in the current project backlog. Consider the following:\n",

    "   - Issues or challenges discussed that may require attention\n",
    "   - New features or improvements suggested\n",
    "   - Any other relevant points that could be translated into backlog items\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Compare each potential new item against the existing backlog to ensure it's not a duplicate or already covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. List ALL possible new items, even if they seem minor. Be thorough in your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. If you identify any possible new items, list them clearly, one per line, prefixed with a hyphen (-).\n",

    "    title [Chart Title]\n",

    "3. Incorporate all the components and relationships mentioned in the plan into your Mermaid code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Ensure that the diagram accurately represents the key points from the meeting as outlined in the plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Keep the diagram clear and concise, avoiding unnecessary complexity.\n",

    "6. Use appropriate styling options available in Mermaid Gantt charts to enhance readability and visual appeal.\n",

    "   - Don't include custom commands like verticalLine or verticalLineFill.\n",
    "   - Don't use click events or custom styling (classDef, class).\n",
    "   - Use the correct syntax for dependencies: \"task_name : after previous_task\".\n",
    "   - Stick to a consistent date format (preferably YYYY-MM-DD).\n",
    "   - Don't include a separate \"Legend\" section; consider adding this information in the chart title if necessary.\n",
    "   - Use the `crit` keyword correctly within task definitions for critical path items.\n",
    "   - Avoid using unsupported features like weekend styling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before generating the final code, wrap your analysis inside <thinking> tags. In this analysis:\n",
    "1. List all components, relationships, and specific requirements from the plan.\n",
