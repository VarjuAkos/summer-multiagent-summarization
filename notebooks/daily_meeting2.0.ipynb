    "<project_backlog>\n",
    "{PROJECT_BACKLOG}\n",

    "   - New features or improvements suggested\n",

    "\n",
    "5. Compare each potential new item against the existing backlog to ensure it's not a duplicate or already covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. List ALL possible new items, even if they seem minor. Be thorough in your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. If you identify any possible new items, list them clearly, one per line, prefixed with a hyphen (-).\n",

Key decisions include the removal of social login options from the initial design and the adoption of a JWT token rotation strategy for enhanced security. The team is prioritizing HIPAA compliance, particularly in data encryption and token storage. User registration implementation is underway, with a focus on secure password hashing using bcrypt. Frontend development is progressing with an emphasis on accessibility, including the implementation of ARIA labels. DevOps efforts are concentrated on setting up separate workflows for different environments in GitHub Actions. Some team members are facing minor setup issues, which are being addressed collaboratively. The project backlog has been updated to reflect these developments, with user registration and basic dashboard layout now in progress. Moving forward, the team will be working on resolving environment setup issues, implementing core authentication features, ensuring HIPAA compliance, finalizing design updates, and completing the CI/CD pipeline setup.\\n</general_info_summary>'}"

      "Dear Liam Foster,\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a summary of today's Daily Scrum Meeting (Sprint 1, Day 2) tailored to your role as UI/UX Designer:\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Points:\n",
      "1. Your wireframes for the authentication flow have been finalized in Figma. Great work on completing this crucial task for the MVP.\n",
      "2. You noted potential adjustments needed for mobile responsiveness, particularly for the registration form. This aligns well with our focus on creating a user-friendly experience across devices.\n",
      "3. You're currently working on the component library documentation, which is a critical resource for the development team.\n",
      "4. You've included micro-interactions in your designs, especially for form submission feedback. This shows your attention to enhancing user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Action Items for You:\n",
      "1. Share the component library documentation by early afternoon today. This is a medium priority task but essential for the team's progress.\n",
      "2. Schedule and conduct a component styling sync with Emily Watson, focusing on MVP requirements. This should be done today and is a high priority task.\n",
      "3. Be prepared to discuss the implementation feasibility and prioritization of micro-interactions with Emily. This may need to be balanced against MVP scope requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Impacts on Your Work:\n",
      "1. The team is facing some delays with the development environment setup, which may affect the timeline for implementing your designs. Stay flexible and prepared to adjust priorities if needed.\n",
      "2. There's ongoing discussion about form validation approaches. Your input on this from a UX perspective may be valuable, especially considering accessibility requirements.\n",
      "3. The authentication components created by Emily are currently functional but unstyled. Your upcoming sync with her will be crucial for aligning the implemented components with your design vision.\n",
      "\n",
      "Team-wide Updates:\n",
      "1. The sprint timeline may be adjusted due to environment setup delays. Sarah Chen will be assessing this by the end of the day.\n",
      "2. All team members are required to update their respective Jira tickets with current status and any blockers by the end of the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your work on finalizing the wireframes and preparing the component library is vital for the team's progress on the MVP. Your collaboration with Emily on styling and micro-interactions will be key in the coming days.\n",

UI/UX design progress (medium priority, supports implementation)\\n</analysis>\\n\\n<general_info_summary>\\nThe Sprint 1 kickoff meeting revealed significant progress on core MVP features, particularly in authentication system implementation and frontend component development. However, the team is facing a critical blocker with AWS credential issues, potentially impacting the entire sprint timeline. The authentication system is progressing with JWT implementation using RS256 algorithm, enhancing security. Frontend components for login, registration, and password reset are functional but require styling and finalization of the validation approach. The database schema design is ready for review, setting the foundation for MVP features. UI/UX wireframes for the authentication flow are complete. Key action items include resolving the AWS credential issues (due end of day), finalizing form validation approach, and conducting a database schema review. The project manager will reassess the sprint timeline considering these developments. All team members are required to update their Jira tickets by end of day to reflect current progress and blockers.\\n</general_info_summary>'}"

Key decisions include adopting two-week sprints with a 20-25% reduced capacity for the first sprint to account for setup time. The team prioritized MVP features: user authentication (using custom JWT), activity tracking, and basic nutrition logging with a simplified food database. Development environment setup, including CI/CD pipeline and Docker containers, is a critical first step. Sprint 1 will focus on establishing the development environment, implementing basic authentication, creating initial user profiles, and starting activity tracking components. The team identified potential challenges in ensuring data model flexibility for future integrations and managing frontend animation performance. These decisions align with the project\\'s core requirements and set a foundation for the six-month MVP timeline. All team members should be aware of daily standups at 10 AM and an upcoming technical session to discuss the database schema in detail.\\n</general_info_summary>'}"
