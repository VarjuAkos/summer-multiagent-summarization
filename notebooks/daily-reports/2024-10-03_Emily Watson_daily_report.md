# Daily Scrum Report for Emily Watson

## Sprint Overview

Our team has made significant progress in Sprint 1, completing 56 out of 99 committed Story Points. While we've achieved a good portion of our goals, we're facing some challenges that require attention:

- CI/CD pipeline issues with test failures and Docker containerization
- Data model scalability concerns for large datasets
- Delays in third-party API integration due to documentation issues

To address these challenges and improve our performance, we're implementing more conservative estimations for complex features and enhancing our sprint planning process.
