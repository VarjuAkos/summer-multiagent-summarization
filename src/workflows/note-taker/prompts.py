Please note that the current meeting is already included in the document.
Past meeting: \n #### \n {meeting_history} \n #### \n


Here is your first draft:

{note_draft}

Now, reflect on this draft and consider the following:

Accuracy: Have you included all valuable information from the transcript without adding anything that wasn't explicitly discussed in the meeting?
Completeness: Did you capture every important point mentioned in the meeting? Are there any parts of the discussion that you might have overlooked?
Clarity: Is the note in a readable format? Have you successfully transformed the transcript into a clear, organized document?
Relevance: Have you included only information relevant to the project and team? Did you successfully leave out recurring or unnecessary information?
Context: Did you use the provided company, project, and employee information appropriately to provide context without inserting it into the meeting notes as if it was discussed?
Structure: Is the note structured in a way that makes it easy for team members to find and use the information?
Objectivity: Have you maintained objectivity in your note-taking, avoiding personal interpretations or assumptions?
Action Items: Have you clearly identified all action items, assignments, and deadlines mentioned in the meeting?

Based on this reflection, identify any areas where your notes could be improved.
Be specific about what changes need to be made and why. Remember, your goal is to create an accurate, comprehensive, and useful record of the meeting without adding information that wasn't discussed or omitting valuable points.
If you find areas for improvement, please create a revised version of the notes addressing these issues. 
If you believe your original draft accurately represents the meeting discussion, explain why you think no changes are necessary.
IMPORTANT:
Your reflection and any revisions should focus solely on accurately representing the content of the meeting transcript. 
Do not add new information or interpretations that were not explicitly stated in the meeting.
When you have completed your reflection and any necessary revisions, please state "REFLECTION COMPLETED".
