# Summary of Multi-Agent System for Meeting Transcript Processing

## Proof of Concept Validation

The initial proof of concept demonstrated that personalized summaries could indeed be generated from a raw meeting transcript, with each summary differing based on the employee's role and responsibilities. This validation confirmed the viability of creating a more comprehensive multi-agent system for automated meeting summary generation.

## System Overview

The proposed system is designed to process raw meeting transcripts and produce personalized summaries, tasks, and relevant diagrams. It consists of two main parts:

1. General Summary Generation
2. Personalization and Output Generation

The system is designed to be flexible, allowing for different workflows based on the type of meeting being processed.

## Key Components

### Part 1: General Summary Generation

1. Input Handler: Preprocesses the raw transcript.
2. Context Retrieval System (RAG): Provides relevant context using a hybrid approach (dense and sparse retrieval).
3. Summary Generation Agent: Creates a comprehensive summary of the transcript.
4. Critic Agent: Evaluates and suggests improvements to the summary.
5. Human-in-the-Loop Interface: Allows for human verification and editing of the summary.

### Part 2: Personalization and Output Generation

1. Personalization Agent: Tailors the general summary for individual employees.
2. Critic Agent: Ensures personalized summaries are appropriate and complete.
3. Diagram Generation Agent: Creates relevant diagrams to supplement the summaries.
4. Workflow-Specific Agents: Handle specialized tasks based on meeting type.
5. Output Formatter: Compiles all generated content into a cohesive output.

## Workflow

1. The raw transcript is input into the system.
2. The first part of the system generates a general summary, using a combination of AI agents and retrieved context.
3. A human verifies and potentially edits the general summary.
4. The second part of the system takes the approved general summary and creates personalized outputs for each employee.
5. Based on the meeting type, additional specific outputs (e.g., sprint backlog, architecture diagrams) are generated.
6. The system compiles all generated content into the final output format (e.g., PDFs, task tickets).

## Meeting Types and Workflows

The system is designed to handle various meeting types, each with its own specific workflow:

1. Sprint Planning: Summary → Personalized tasks → Sprint backlog creation → Capacity planning
2. Technical Design Meeting: Summary → Architecture diagram → Personalized tasks
3. Retrospective Meeting: Summary → Action items → Team health metrics → Improvement suggestions
4. Brainstorming Session: Summary → Idea clustering → Feasibility assessment → Action plan

## Key Features

1. Modular Design: Allows for easy addition of new meeting types and workflows.
2. Context-Aware: Uses a RAG system to incorporate relevant company, project, and employee information.
3. Iterative Improvement: Utilizes a critic agent to refine summaries and outputs.
4. Human Oversight: Includes a human-in-the-loop step for verification and editing.
5. Personalization: Tailors outputs to individual employee roles and responsibilities.
6. Visual Aid: Incorporates relevant diagrams to enhance understanding.

This system design aims to automate and streamline the process of generating actionable insights and tasks from meeting transcripts, while maintaining accuracy through AI assistance and human oversight.
